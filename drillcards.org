with formatting SD-cards
as internal?
**** Answer:
Speed, because SD-cards 
are slower than internal
memory. If buying an
SD-card to boost internal
memory, make sure it is
high-speed, ie UHS-1 type
or better.

What are the consequences of
formatting an SD-card as 
internal on Android 6.0+?
**** Answer:
After migrating data, the
removal of the SD-card will
break applications that moved
their data to the SD-card
unless the data are moved back.
Thus, SD-cards formatted in
this way aren't meant to be
swapped in and out of the 
device.

Why is the /hour angle/
of an object of interest?
**** Answer:
It indicates the location
of the object relative
to the meridian in terms
of time. A negative value
indicates a position east
of the meridian, a positive
value one west of the 
meridian. A value of zero
means the object has reached
its highest point the sky.

time equals the time of its
right ascension.

Why are nonlinear activation
function needed for neural
networks?
**** Answer:
Because with only linear
activations any network
would be equivalent to a
simple affine transformation,
no matter how many layers
there are.

What is /backpropagation/
all about?
**** Answer:
This is where the loss
function /f(y,ŷ)/ of
actual label /y/ and
and predicted label /ŷ/
is optimized. It is a
function of weights, 
biases and activations
and the optimization
is usually done by a
gradient descent method
of this function.

What is the activation
function of a network layer?
**** Answer:
The evolution of a network 
layer is given by an affine 
transformation
/x↦y=Ax+b/ followed by the 
application of a nonlinear
function /f/ to its result /y/.
This function is called the 
activation function of the layer.

for the kernel perceptron obtained?
**** Answer:
From Mercer's theorem: If the 
kernel /K(*x,y*)/ is symmetric and
positive semidefinite then 
/[Tₖφ](x)=∫K(x,s)φ(s)ds/ is a linear
operator and /K/ can be written as
/K(s,t)=∑λⱼφⱼ(s)φⱼ(t)/ in terms of
eigenvectors /φᵢ/ of /Tₖ/, which
is essentially diagonalization
of /K/.

What is the effect of the

**** Answer:
The learning rate only affects
which training vectors become
part of the final weight vector
but not the hyperplane itself because
it will be of the form
/⟨r∑ Δᵢxᵢ,x⟩=r∑Δᵢ/, where
the /xᵢ/ are samples misclassified
during the training run.

Under which circumstances
does the learning rate have
minimal influence on the result

**** Answer:
When the initial weight vector
and the bias are zero. In that
case, the final result is of the 
form /⟨w,x⟩=b/ with
/w=r∑Δᵢxᵢ/, /b=r∑Δᵢ/, /xᵢ/ misclassified
training vectors. But multiplying
the equation of a hyperplane
by a nonzero constant doesn't
change the hyperplane.

What to do about the 
/illegal instruction/ error
in all the tensorflow python 
packages?
**** Answer:
The publicly available packages
are compiled with AVX instructions.
On a machine without them, compile
a python wheel from source using
~bazel~ as per the instructions on 
the tensorflow website.

How does /cmake/ compare
to /make/?
**** Answer:
Not at all, /cmake/ is 
a generalisation of /autotools/
to more systems than just
unix, generating buildfiles
for different systems. Thus
when used on unix-like
systems it is more comparable
to /automake/ than /make/.

Why would implementing
a typed language like
Haskell for the Erlang
VM be difficult?
**** Answer:
It would probably work
if one forgoes the 
function overloading
in the Erlang VM in 
favour of type 
polymorphism.

What is the main
reason for the =.()=
kludge?
**** Answer:
The Erlang VM, which
essentially requires
Lisp 2 type implementations 
where variables and 
functions live in different
namespaces, hence the
different calling conventions
for variables referring to
functions and proper functions.

Why do Erlang and Elixir
require different namespaces
for variables and functions?
**** Answer:
Because (named) functions are 
identified by both name and 
arity in the Erlang VM, which 
makes Lisp 1 implementations 
awkward.

What is the rap on
the =do:...=
expressions in elixir?
**** Answer:
These are actually 
keyword lists
and equivalent to
=[{:do,...}]=, which can
be rewritten as
=[do: ...]= due to some
syntactic sugar. If the 
keyword list is the last
argument of a function, the
square brackets can be
dropped and =do:...=
is the result.

functions behave
differently from
anonymous ones?
**** Answer:
Anonymous functions
are closures, ie they
access values in their
environment. In contrast,
a =def= introduces a clean
name scope.

Because of piping, where

of the function call that is
next in the pipe.

Why is the fudge with
the =.()= notation for
anonymous functions
needed in elixir?
**** Answer:
Mostly because of the 
different namespaces for
functions and variables.
But also, arguments
can be permuted in anonymous
functions defined by a capture,
which needs to sort out the
=&1, &2,...= etc.

**** Answer:
According to /iex/, 
this is a function of
arity =1=, but applying
an argument to it as in
=(&(&1 * 2).(5)).(2)=
is accepted by the
compiler but results
in a run-time error

Why is piping actually
not such a great idea
for Elixir?
**** Answer:
Because Elixir aims to
be functional but piping
is imperative and should
be restricted to something
like monads.
In addition, it causes a 
lot of bad design decisions, 
such as function capturing 
and =.()=.

the second argument of a
function =Foo.bar/2=?
**** Answer:
With a capture

where =arg1= is a constant for
the first argument. So
=Foo.bar= is called as
=Foo.bar(arg1,val)=.

What is the problem when variables
in the /varlist/ of a =let= have value
/nil/ even though values were assigned to them?
**** Answer:
Check for proper parenthesing: the /varlist/ 
can contain variablenames and =(variable value)=
pairs, only in the latter case is the =variable=
asigned a value. A list of the form 
=(symbol1 symbol2)= creates two variables names 
=symbol1= and =symbol2= with values =nil=, 
not a variable name =symbol1= with value 
=symbol2=.

They are both used to call functions, the
only difference is how arguments are handled.
Whilst =funcall= treats the arguments after the 
function as arguments of the function, =apply=
inserts them into the list given by the last 
argument.

How are minor modes
disabled interactively?
**** Answer:
Normally by calling the
minor mode function:
~M-x some-mode-function-mode~
because minor mode functions
should be written to toggle
the mode if called interactively
without a prefix argument. 
Alternatively, call the minor 
mode function with a negative 
prefix argument to disable it, 
with a positive one to enable 
it.

How to put org-mode 
tables into an sqlite
database?
**** Answer:
Give the org-table a name
and start an ~sqlite~ source
block defining a variable referring
to the table, ie with
~:var orgtable=name~ in its header.
In the source block create a
table /sqltab/ to reflect the structure
of the org table and run
~.import $orgtab sqltab~.

The widget-name and class

~widgetPath~ output.
The window id is 
merely used to extract
widgets from the builder.

What to do when something
hits an infinite loop?
**** Answer:
Set break-points on
exception with 
=:set -fbreak-on-exception=,
run the program and hit
Ctrl-C when it is in an
infinite loop. Traverse
the resulting history 
with =:back= to see what was
going on.

complains about a
nonexhaustive pattern
in a function?
**** Answer:
Make sure exceptions create
a break-point with
:set -fbreak-on-exception
then run the function and
step back through the history
list with :back. Variables
and source can be inspected
as usual.

Why is packing values
into a list with
something like
=flip (:) [] :: a -> [a]=
not such a superb idea?
**** Answer:
Because something like
~pure :: a->[] a~ or
~return :: a-> [] a~ seems
more appropriate since
list are both applicative
and monads. Called in the
right context, the type
annotations aren't even
necessary.

The fact that the success of

types is only ascertained
at run-time. There should
be a mechanism like with the
persistent database where
*.glade files are analysed at
compile time like database
content, as well as the
types of new widgets.

As of [2018-11-23], eta
needs ghc-7.10.3, whose
last lts is 6.35, so
stack can be configured
to use that. Check for
libraries for eta on 
https://github.com/typelead/eta-hackage
and list them as extra
dependencies if they are 
newer than those from
lts 6.35.

Why is GADT syntax
necessary for homotopy
types?
**** Answer:
Because for a Homotopy
type, not only the type
needs to be constructed
but also equality types
over the type. Thus, control
over the return type of
constructors is needed, which
may construct elements of
equality types over the 
base type in addition to elements
of the base type. This control
is provided by GADT syntax.

Where is error reporting
with =failure= superior to
error reporting with =fail=?
**** Answer:
When the error arises from
the syntax because =failure=
conforms to the expected-
unexpected reporting format.
On the other hand, =fail= is
free-style and should be used
if the syntax is correct but
a generated value is illegal,
perhaps out of bounds or
some such.

Why is the use of =failure=
to report a parse error
as a string not recommended?
**** Answer:
Because it seems like a
bit of overkill, reporting
a parsing failure as a string
can be done simply with the
monadic fail function as
=fail <errorMessage>=.

Why should megaparsec 
parsers not be built with

**** Answer:
Because Megaparsec has the
more efficient ~takeWhileP~

The second argument is a ~String~
describing a source to be used
as a description in error messages.
As such it is more general than
a source file.

Why does the =H= executable
in the global path not work?
**** Answer:
Because it is a /ghci/-wrapper
which tries to load modules
from the /inline-r/ library, which
would need to be installed with 
/cabal/. Try to run it as
=stack exec H=, which should work
if /inline-r/ is installed in the 
global /stack/ project.

How to define a default
for a record data-type?
**** Answer:
Use module ~Data.Default~ 
where a ~Default~ type-class
with one method ~def~ is
defined. Define an 
~instance Default Typename~
  ~where def= Typename {...}~
of that type-class and use
it.

**** Answer:
By running

way, the resolver packages don't 
need to be downloaded and an
existing compiler will be used,
rather than installed by
~stack build~.

How to install something
like /H/ globally with stack?
**** Answer:
Since /H/ calls /ghci/ and loads
some modules, these dependencies
probably need to be listed in
the ~extra-deps~ of the global
configuration before doing
a global ~stack install H~.
Or they should be given as
options in =stack build= as
ie =–extra-deps <library>=.

**** Answer:
Locally, in a project directory

yet ~stack build --copy-compiler-tool <tool>~.
This has the effect of just copying the
tool for projects using the same version
of the compiler even if the lts is
different. ~stack exec~ will then arrange
for the executables to end up in the 
correct path.

What is the main point
when constructing Gadts?
**** Answer:
That the constructors can
have any signature as long
as they return a =T a= for
some =a= when constructing
a =data T a=.

What is the real clincher
for using Gadts?
**** Answer:
The ease of pattern matching
where things like
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
eval (Lit i)=i
eval (IsZero b)=b
#+END_SRC
become possible for
a =data T a= with constructors
=Lit :: Int -> T Int=

that are not algebraic
in Haskell?
**** Answer:
Yes, in-built datatypes like
=Int=, =Float= are not algebraic 
because they don't have 
constructors.

What is the significance
of the =((->) e)= monad
regarding λ-calculus?
**** Answer:
It implements the =K = λxy.x=
combinator as
=pure :: a -> e -> a=
and the =S = λxyz. xz(yz)= 
combinator as 
=<*> :: (e -> a -> b) -> (e -> a) -> e -> b=
in its =Applicative= instance. 
Every λ-calculus expression can be 
written using these two combinators.

Why is something like 
~data Type = forall a.Const a~
called an existential data-type?

Since constructors prove the
existence of something, one like
above proves the existence of an
=a= that leads to a value of =Type=.
Compare this to
~data Type a = Const a~
where =a= is universally
quantified, ie there is
a value of =Type= for every
=a=.

Why is something like
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  data Eq a => Set a = MkSet [a]

**** Answer:
Because for
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data Set a where
  MkSet::Eq a => [a] -> Set a
#+END_SRC
a pattern match with =MkSet=
provides an implicit dictionary
for =Eq= whereas in the non-Gadt
version such a pattern match
would require an explicit
=Eq a= constraint. (Note that
constraints like that in the
constructor are now obsolete
and require a compiler extension.)

say that an existential

Observations are the access

constraints. For example
=Integral= provides observation
=toInteger= whereas =Num= provides
no observations at all.

How to check if a
type-level natural number
is positive with the
GHC.TypeLits library?
**** Answer:
With a constraint of the 
form
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
(KnownNat n, CmpNat n 0 ~ GT) => 
 List n a...
#+END_SRC
which would make sure that
the list argument is not
empty.

a bit of a misnomer?
**** Answer:
Because it /generalises/
union types rather than
algebraic datatypes.

What is the difference
between /Algebraic/ and
/Generalised Algebraic/
datatypes in terms of
the sets of their values?
**** Answer:
For /Algebraic/ datatypes
the sets of values are 
constructed as combinations
of disjoint unions and
cartesian products. For
/Generalised Algebraic/ 
datatypes, the sets of
values include fixed
points of operators on
sets as well.

What is the difference
of /Algebraic/ and
/Generalised Algebraic/
datatypes in terms of
constructors?
**** Answer:
In an /Algebraic/ datatype,
every constructor for the
datatype returns a value
of the same type, ie in
union types. With 
/Generalised Algebraic/ types,
different constructors can
return values of different
types.

What is the difference
between /Algebraic/ and

**** Answer:
/Generalised Algebraic/ 
datatypes are obtained
when type /operators/ are

operators F of kind * -> *.
In contrast, merely algebraic
datatypes are obtained as
sums, products and recursively
defined /types/ but not

What is the point of =Nat=
in GHC.TyeLits if it is not
recursively defined?
**** Answer:
It is meant to be used more
as a documentation type than
a recursive one. Thus, vectors
or lists with length in their
type should be constructed
from their normal counterparts
using reification and reflection
to get the length types right.
The tools for that are all in
the library.

Why will constructing a List with
typed length from input fail?
**** Answer:
Because the length is not known
at compile time, only that a
length exists. Thus, the list
with typed length needs to hide
in an existential data-type.

let the existential type escape.

=where= keyword and definitions
are provided as instances:
~type instance <Name> <variables>=...~

Because it can prove =Not (Not a)=
by way of the =throw= and =catch=
mechanism with

with 
=throw :: a -> Void=.

Why are data-kinds derived
from types and =*= treated
differently?
**** Answer:
Because the derived kinds are
more restricted as they can
only assume types generated
from their constructors. For
example the kind =Bool= can
only have types ='True= and
='False=.

between the kinds produced

They are normally different

result in them both being
matched by kind variables ~k~.

What is the difference
in kind annotations 
=F :: k -> *= and
G :: * -> * ?
**** Answer:
G is a type operator
producing a type from a type.
F, on the other hand, is an
operator that produces a type
from any kind, at least if
extension =PolyKinds= is active
because in that case =k= is 
considered a kind variable.

right order of the type variables,
then come the argument values. Type
applications for the next rank of
variables then follow these values
followed by their own values etc.

What turns javascript variables declared
 with /var/ into a minefield for the normal
programmer?
**** Answer
The fact that they are not block-scoped but
function scoped. Thus, a variable declared in
a loop will be visible even before the loop
in its ambient function. This leads to 
unexpected behaviour. In addition, it is 
possible to make a /var/ declaration
several times with the same variable.

Can the /for .. of/ loop be used to
iterate over objects?
**** Answer
If the specification is ES6
or higher. For TypeScript generating
javascript for ES5 or lower, the object 
needs to have a /length/ property for this 
to work because the generated code
is a classical for loop with an index
variable.

Is there a way to achieve nominal typing in
typescript?
**** Answer:
Since /enum/s are nominally typed, define a
dedicated /enum/ for a type and form the 
intersection of the two. Note that this does
not work if the type is a /number/ because 
/enum/'s are compatible with /number/.

This turns a variable of any type into a

and a second one negates it back in the 
opposite /boolean truth/ value.

**** Answer:
Because they must be accessed through /this/.
Since the /this/ of the derived class contains
the members of the derived class and those of
the base class, having the same name would 
lead to conflicts.

**** Answer:
The value of /this/ is different. Defining
=this.funcname = function(...){...}= sets /this/
to the calling context of whoever calls 
=objname.funcname()=. On the other hand, with
=this.funcname = (...) => {...}=, =this= always
refers to the =this= of the defining context, 
no matter who calls =objname.funcname=.

Does the macro function
in a root macro have to be
of signature =void -> void=?
**** Answer:
No, it can have arguments and
return something. Arguments can
be passed as in
=.x filename(arg1,arg2,...)=
when running it from a root
shell.

Is it possible to turn
root macros into stand-alone
GUI-applications?
**** Answer:
Yes, the main function has
to run the macro function
via root class =TApplication= as in
#+BEGIN_SRC C++
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
TApplication app("ROOT Application", &argc, argv);
StandaloneApplication(app.Argc(), app.Argv());
app.Run();
return 0;
}
#+END_SRC
where =StandaloneApplication= calls
the macro.

Should macros normally be 
compiled when loading them
into a root shell?
**** Answer:
Probably not, because a macro
normally lacks the includes
of header files since they are
not required by the C-interpreter.
Only if the macro needs to become
part of a standalone package is
the required effort justifiable.

Why is it better to use
=pulp --psc-package init=

=pulp init= and then removing

=psc-package init=?
**** Answer:
Because =pulp init= installs
some dependencies in addition
to /Prelude/ for running the
repl and in- and output. On
the other hand, =psc-package=
only installs /Prelude/
and some of the functionality
would be missing.

How to make sure =pulp= uses
the dependencies from
=psc-package= instead of
=bower=?
**** Answer:
Whilst there is a 
=–psc-package= option
for =pulp= that can be used
in its commands, the easiest
way is to remove the =bower.json=
file, it will fall back
to the =psc-package= files.

signify in purescript?
**** Answer:
It indicates a natural
transformation between
functors =F₁:: * -> *= and
=F₂:: * -> *= where
=f :: F₁ ~> F₂= means
=f :: F₁ a -> F₂ a=,
ie the type variable can be

Is ~ifelse~ the only way
to have a functional
style ~if~ statement?
**** Answer:
No, its use is actually
discouraged unless the
test in ~ifelse(test,yes,no)~
actually involves a list.
If ~test~ is a simple true/false
result, use
~if(test) yes else no~,
which is more efficient.
It behaves like a function 
returning ~yes~ or ~no~.

to calculate the dot product
of vectors in R?
**** Answer:
Matrix multiplication ~%*%~. It
will cast vectors to matrices
with ~as.matrix~. Note that
/⟨u,v⟩/ is usually written as
~t(u) %*% v~ because vectors are
columns by default, hence /u/ 
should be transposed to a row.

How to create nested
vectors in R?
**** Answer:
They have to be put into
lists as in
#+BEGIN_SRC R
tlst[[1]] <- c(0.1,0.2,0.3)
tlst[[2]] <- 1
#+END_SRC
which creates a list consisting
of a vector and a value.
Note that this can be given
names.

Is it always necessary
to push a private development
branch to github and create
a pull request to update the
master branch on github?
**** Answer:
No, it is also possible
to rebase in the private 
branch and then push with
~git push <remote> HEAD:master~
which will push the head
of the current branch to 
the master on <remote>.

What happens if answering /yes/
to the checkout question when
saving a file under git control
in emacs?
**** Answer:
The buffer of the file switches
to /readonly/ after saving the 
content. The only way to edit
it afterwards is to check it 
back in.

What to do after forgetting
to switch from the master
to a development branch
if changes have been already
made in the master branch?
**** Answer:
Stash the changes in the 
master branch with 
~git stash~. Then switch
them to a (new) branch
with
~git stash branch <branchname>~,
this will pop the stash
into ~<branchname>~ and drop
it from master, which is
now clean.

What's the problem if
=git rebase -X theirs master=
does nothing, reporting
/Current branch <name> is up to date/?
**** Answer:
That means there was no
activity on the master
branch since the current
branch branched off from
it, ie the current branch
is already based at HEAD
of master.

What's the problem if after
=git rebase master= the master
branch is still the same?
**** Answer:
That is to be expected,
=rebase= just changes the
topic branch to now start
at the HEAD of master. To
change /master/ a merge request
has to be issued from master.
If the =rebase= was successful, 
there will be no merge
conflicts.

What is the recommendation
on setting the owner password
in addition to the user
password on a pdf file?
**** Answer:
For keylengths 40 and 128 setting
the owner password provides some
additional security as the user
password is encrypted with the
owner password. For key-length
256, the owner password is 
mandatory as many viewers will
show the document without asking
for the user password if the 
owner password is empty.

What is the whole thing
of "born of woman" all
about in the gnostic
scriptures?
**** Answer:
This is probably a reference
to the botched creation of
humans as a result of Sophia's
separation of male and female.
Those "born of woman" are her
descendants via the demiurg and
not fully in harmony with the
dyadic creations of the Universe.

Why the emphasis on
hating one's relatives?

This is perhaps a bit
strong but indicates
the need to become
independent of the peer
pressure exerted by relatives,
which might have prevented
the mission of Jesus.

What distinguishes natural
from unnatural transformations
between functors /F, G/?
**** Answer:
In a natural transformation,
the commutativity in
/η(Y)∘F(f)=G(f)∘η(X)/ only
depends on objects 
/X, Y/ of the source
category but not on
the morphism /f/. In an
unnatural transformation
there are morphisms where
this commutativity with
/η(X), η(Y)/ is violated.

Why is the presence of
an initial object
in a category with
finite limits and colimits not
surprising?
**** Answer:
Because a finite colimit of
no object would correspond 
to a disjoint union of no
sets, hence the empty set
which is a special case of
an initial object.

Why is the presence of
terminal objects in a

**** Answer:
Terminal objects are like
one element sets, since 
there is an initial set
a terminal object should
be constructible by packing
the initial object.

How to construct the

**** Answer:
Write /M=P*DP/ with /D/ diagonal
and /D=E²/, which is possible
because of positive real 
eigenvalues (note /M/ is hermitian).
Then /M=(EP)*EP/, so the column
vectors /vᵢ/ (ie multiples of the
eigenvectors) of /EP/ satisfy
/M=(⟨vᵢ,vⱼ⟩)/.

How to construct a common

**** Answer:
Take an eigenbasis of /A/, say.
Then /B=diag(B₁,B₂,…)/ with
hermitian operators /Bᵢ/ in terms
of that basis. Since the /Bᵢ/ are
hermitian, they can be 
diagonalised separately, leading
to a common eigenbasis for
both /A/ and /B/.

Why does /P²/ generally
have more eigenvectors
than /P/?
**** Answer:
If /P/ has negative

squaring causes degeneracy
of the corresponding
eigenspaces. Thus every
linear combinations of vectors
from /|-λ⟩/ and /|λ⟩/ is an
eigenvector of /P²/.

The quotient O(1,3)/SO⁺(1,3) is isomorphic
the the group spanned by time-reversal and
space-inversion. Thus, any arbitrary
Lorentz transformation is a semi-direct
product of an element of /SO⁺(1,3)/ and
a space-time inversion.

characters make sense for
infinite groups?
**** Answer:
Not in general since characters
are defined only on finite
representations. For example, 
for compact groups every 
irreducible representation
is finite dimensional, so 
characters are still a useful
tool for studying them.

In which sense does the positive

**** Answer:
/A/ is the positive square root of

are self adjoint, they behave in a
sense like positive real numbers, so
/|T|/ is a bit like a length.

What is the point of constructing
Heisenberg groups from symplectic
vector spaces?
**** Answer:
In the Darboux basis of the
space the coefficients are
like canonically conjugate
variables and with the Heisenberg
group on them they obtain
quantum-mechanical meaning.

when considering containment
of permutations?
**** Answer:
The interest actually lies
with /avoidance/. A permutation
/π/ avoids /σ/ if /π/ doesn't contain
/σ/. Of interest is the number
/Sₙ(π)/, which is the number of
/n/-permutations avoiding /π/. For
every /π/ there is a constant
/c(π)/ such that /Sₙ(π)≤c(π)ⁿ/.

How to convert multivariate
polyonmials to univariate
ones?
**** Answer:
By Kronecker substitution:
If the partial degrees of the 
multivariate polynomial 
/f(x₁,x₂,…,xₙ) are
/(d₁,d₂,…,dₙ)/ then 
/f̂(x,xᵈ¹,…,xᵈⁿ)/ is univariate
of degree /∏dᵢ/ or less. This map 
is monic as long as the degree
bounds are observed.

/exp(±a∂ₜ^½x)/. Expanding and
factoring out the fractional
derivative then yields the

What is the advantage of the Lie derivative
over covariant derivatives on a manifold? 
**** Answer:
Covariant derivatives depend on the metric of
the manifold whereas Lie-type derivatives don't.

Why can tensors always
be represented in two
dimensions?
**** Answer:
Because there are only
two types of indices, namely
upper and lower. These
can be assigned to columns and 
rows, respectively, so any 
tensor can be represented 
recursively as a 
combination of rows or 
columns of rows or
columns.

Where does the name
/contravariant/ for
coefficients of basis
vectors come from?
**** Answer:
If a vector is to be
basis independent, its 
coefficients have to
/contra-vary/ with a change
of basis in order to
compensate for the change
in basis.

How can tensor indices
be related to rows and
columns?
**** Answer:
In the usual notation
with vectors as columns, 
contravariant vectors
/(aⁱ)/ correspond to
column vectors and covariant
tensors /(aᵢ)/ to rows. The rest
follows from considering
higher order tensors as row
or columns of lower order
tensors according to the position
of the last index.

In which sense is the use of
the tensor symbol ⊗ for the
second conjunction in linear
logic appropriate?
**** Answer:
In a quantum sense because
/A⊗B/ seems to aptly describe
the behaviour of entangled
quantum systems. Measuring
/A⊗B/ allows no conclusions
regarding the respective states 
of the components /A,B/.

What is the difference
between a /Proposition/
/A/ and a judgement /⊢ A/?
**** Answer:
A proposition /A/ is an 
internal statement of a 
theory whereas the 
judgement /⊢ A/ is a 
meta-statement. For
example in first order
logic where the only
judgement is the possession
of a proof, /⊢ A/ means
"A has a proof".

Why the emphasis on
the fact that there 
are true theorems 
that can not be proved in
an undecidable theory?
**** Answer:
Because false Theorems can
never be proved in a 
consistent theory. Thus,
the defining feature of
undecidability is the 
existence of non-false
theorems that can't be
proved.

Why is /A ⊢ B/ not the same
as /⊢ A → B/?
**** Answer:
Because it means /B/ can be 
deduced from /A/ independently
of the logic used. The implication
arrow is tied to the logic used
and may not even be available in
a given logic. For example, in
linear logic /A ⊢ B/ means 
/⊢ A ⊸ B/, there is no /→/.

Why is the recursion
principle for a type
/W/ also called the 
non-dependent eliminator?
**** Answer:
Because it is about constructing
functions out of type /W/, which
are called eliminators. The
/non-dependent/ qualifier serves to
distinguish it from induction
principles, which are about 
constructing dependent functions
out of a type and therefore more
general eliminators.

How is the induction
principle of a type

**** Answer:
The induction principle
is about the construction
of dependent functions /f/ 
from constructors where
/f:∏(w:W),P(w)/ for a
/P:W→𝒰/. The recursion
principle is the special case
where /P/ is constant.

What is the recursion
principle for a type
/W/ all about?
**** Answer:
It means that in order
to define any function
/f:W→P/ it is enough to
consider the case where
/w:W/ arises from one of
the constructors. This
makes it possible to
call /f/ recursively on
the inputs to that 
constructor.

How does Homotopy Type Theory
avoid the difficulties in
representing common mathematical
objects inherent in an intensional
type theory?
**** Answer:
By allowing higher order
constructors constructing
elements of equality datatypes
and equality datatypes of
equality datatypes ad
infinitum.

Why is an intensional type
theory desirable as underpinning
for a programming language?
**** Answer:
Because type checking is decidable
in an intensional theory as
definitional and propositional
equality are distinguished.

What is the determining
feature of /extensional/
type theory?
**** Answer:
The fact that there is no
distinction between definitional
and propositional equality, 
presumably due to the fact that
entities are defined extensionally,
ie. by listing all inhabitants of
a type.

Why is a dependent function
type for /A:𝒰/ and /B:A→𝒰/

Because of its similarity
to a cartesian product where
the sequences consist of
function values indexed by
the corresponding arguments.

Why can the *0* type not
be populated in a
consistent type theory?
**** Answer:
Because its negation
¬ *0*: *0* → *0* is inhabited
by the identity function.

In which sense differs
type theory from first
order logic as deductive 
system?
**** Answer:
In contrast to first
order logic, type theory
has two judgements
 - /a:A/ "a is an objec of type A"
 - /a≡b:A/ "a and b are definitionally
          equal objects of type A"
as compared to the one of
first order logic
/⊢ A/ "A has a proof".

identified with particular 
types.

How does a linear
constraint /Ax=b/ affect
a gradient descent?
**** Answer:
For consecutive points
/xₖ/, xₖ₊₁ satisfying /Ax=b/,
the difference /Δx/ must
lie in the kernel of /A/. Thus
the steepest feasible descent
is along the projection of
the negative gradient into
the kernel of /A/ and not along
that gradient.

How are leaving and

related?
**** Answer:
For entering variable
/xᵢ/, the new direction
is determined as
/p=eᵢ-(B⁻¹Aeᵢ|0)ᵀ/ where
/A=(B|N)/ with /N/ representing
the zero variables of the 
current vertex /x/. The new
vertex is calculated as
/x+μ⁻¹p/ where /μ=max{pᵢ/xᵢ|xᵢ>0}/.
This calculation determines
the leaving variable.

several such indices, one of
the choice rules for entering
variables has to be invoked, 
such as the /Devex Algorithm/.

How are non-locality
and boundary conditions
related?
**** Answer:
Boundaries may induce 
non-locality, for example
if a gas is constrained by
a boundary causing reflection
of particles back into
the gas. This creates a
dependency on previous events
and causes a nonlocality in
time.

**** Answer:
A generalization of a random

~X:Ω → E~ where ~(E,ε)~ is a
measurable space such that
~X⁻¹(B)~ has a probability
for every ~B∈ε~. Thus, it is
essentially a random variable

Is it possible to interpret
matrix elements /aᵢⱼ/ as 
costs to travel from node
/j/ to /i/?
**** Answer:
Not with the usual matrix
multiplication. The problem
is that the cost of two step
travel from node /i/ to /j/ is
/minₖ{aᵢₖ+aₖⱼ}/ rather than
regular matrix multiplication.
This works only if multiplication
is defined as /a⊗b=a+b/ and 
summation as /a⊕b=min{a,b}/.

What is the most natural
interpretation of matrix
elements /aᵢⱼ/ in the sense

nodes /i/ and /j/?
**** Answer:
The matrix element /aᵢⱼ/
designates some kind of
flow-through capacity
from node /j/ to node /i/.
This is also in keeping
with the usual matrix
multiplication, which
would model the flow of
quantities /xₖ/ through
a graph.

If permutation matrices
permute the indices of
vectors, how do more general
0-1 matrices act on indices?
**** Answer:
There would be a superposition
of indices which could collapse
to a certain index. On the 
other hand, the superposition
could relate to the pre-images
of an index. So if /xₙ↦xᵢ+xⱼ/ this
would mean that /i/ and /j/ are 
preimages of /n/.
Also compare to the interpretation
of 0-1 matrices as paths connecting
nodes.

What is the connection
of emergent phenomena with
phase transitions?
**** Answer:
An emergent phenomenon
depends an a particular
configuration of the subunits
of an agglomeration. Phase
transitions are transitions
between configurations causing
an emergent property.

What is the geometrical
intuition behind the 
Hamiltonian in classical
mechanics?
**** Answer:
Since /H:ℝ²ⁿ → ℝ/, it
describes a mountain
on /ℝ²ⁿ/ and the possible
paths allowed by /H/ in
/ℝ²ⁿ/ are the projections
of the contour lines of 
that mountain onto /ℝ²ⁿ/.

for the problem at hand. Find
a suitable Hamiltonian /H/ for

How do the equations
/ṗ=-∂ᵣH(p,r), q̇=∂ₚH(p,r)/
for the contours for a
2-dimensional Hamiltonian
follow from the mountain
picture?
**** Answer:
The gradient of /H/ is
/∇H=(∂ₚH(p,r),∂ᵣH(p,r))/
which is the direction
of steepest descent. Contour
lines are perpendicular to
that, so /(-∂ᵣH(p,r),∂ₚH(p,r)/)
must coincide with the tangent
vectors (ṗ,q̇).

Because the time-like component

operator should change position
eigenstates.

What could be the 
interpretation of
/E²-c²p²/ for operators
/E, p/ in quantum
mechanics?
**** Answer:
Since /E²-c²p²/ is 
relativistically 
invariant, it should be
related to particle number
or density. It is akin to
a Hamiltonian, the dirac
equation being a factor, thus
its eigenvalues are energy
eigenvalues. Since relativistic
observers differ about energy
but not particle number, the
latter makes the most sense.

**** Answer:
Like the set of coherent

basis for the Hilbert space and
still yield useful values for
operator expectations, as long
as their density matrix is
diagonalisable.
(Note this is more like a Krylov
space, so the /Hⁿv/ should probably
be orthogonalized, as in Lanzcos)

How to explain superluminal
effects within quantum systems?

By not being able to measure
them externally. External
interactions lead to decoherence
and a spatial collapse, thus
preventing external energy
transport.
(Perhaps any interaction that
could lead to superluminal
effects causes decoherence!)

**** Answer:
To accommodate things like

different observers have a
different view of a state. 
Thus, different state vectors
could describe the same state,
in this case all vectors in
an irreducible representation
of the Lorentz group, which is
a vector space.

How to handle particles
in a relativistic context?
**** Answer:
Every relativistic observer
has a different view of the
evolution of a particle, so
each observer has its own 
Hamiltonian. If these 
Hamiltonians have some 
algebraic structure, their
irreducible representations
would qualify as particle 
representations. Especially
if they turn out to be the
same as those of the Lorentz
group.

Could particles be defined as
eigenstates of some space-time
operator instead of a Hamiltonian?
**** Answer:
Possibly, by summarizing the
different Hamiltonians of 
different relativistic observers,
look at the irreducible representations
obtained from their structure and 
then constructing on operator from
that, such as the Casimir operator, 
possibly also employing the relevant
Lorentz group.

**** Answer:
The Heisenberg group is a
group of upper-triangular
matrices whose Lie-algebra
has the same commutation
relations as the position-
momentum operators in 
quantum physics.

Why is /tr (PⱼA)=⟨σⱼ|A|σⱼ⟩/
for projection operator
/Pⱼ=|σⱼ⟩⟨σⱼ|/?
**** Answer:
Because /tr(PⱼA)=∑ᵢ⟨σᵢ|PⱼA|σᵢ⟩/.
Note that
/⟨σᵢ|PⱼA|σᵢ⟩=∑ₖ⟨σᵢ|Pⱼ|σₖ⟩⟨σₖ|A|σᵢ⟩/

so that a nonzero term is

Why is the example of
the glove pair sent to
two parties not a good
model for entanglement?
**** Answer:
Because entanglement is more
like splitting up an infinite
number of pairs of different
sizes between two parties and
determining handedness for
a particular size. The size
would correspond to the
direction of spin measurement
and handed-ness to spin in
the chosen direction.

Just as correlation does

a distance make more sense
than hidden variables?
**** Answer:
Because in many cases an
infinite number of hidden

a variable is needed for every

hidden variable theories and
non-locality?
**** Answer:
In hidden variable theories,
correlations are set up at
the time of entanglement. In
non-locality, correlations are
set up at the time of measurement.
(Like lazy evaluation, a property
is determined when it is needed.)

Why is superluminal
communication through
a shared entangled
system not possible?
**** Answer:
Because the correlated properties
of the system can not be
manipulated, only measured.
Thus, sharing an entangled
electron pair doesn't allow
to communicate via spin because
the sender would have to set
a certain spin state. But the
state can only be measured, not
set.

In which sense are fermion
fields less uncertain than

**** Answer:
There is less uncertainty
in the particle number
because in fermion fields
states /|n⟩/, /n∈{0,1}/ rather

states are superpositions
of only /|0⟩, |1⟩/ rather

What makes the use of coherent
spaces so attractive in quantum

/⟨g(Ω,â,â⁺)⟩=∫f(Ω,α,α*)g(Ω,α,α*)dα dα*/
with a quasiprobability /f/ that depends
on the ordering /Ω/ of the operators.

**** Answer:
Since they relate to the irreducible representations
of the proper Lorentz group on the Hilbert
space, they can be classified by two parameters
/m/ and /s/ commonly related to mass and spin. 
However, representations related to imaginary 
masses and continuous spin are discarded as
unphysical.

wave equations ?
**** Answer:
Because the irreducible representations of the 
(proper) Lorentz group on the Hilbert space 
corresponding to /m>0/ can have only spins of 
integer and half-integer values. Thus, for 
positive mass the representations can be 
described in terms of wave-equations.

Why is the description of a quantum field
theory in terms of creation and annihilation
operators on a Hilbert space the natural 
thing to do?
**** Answer:
Because of its relationship with measurements
which consist of counting particles, be it
with Geiger counters or in particle accelerators.
The composition /vₖ=uₖ⁺uₖ/ of a creation
with an annihilation operator results in a counting
operator which counts the number of particles of
a given type in a given state.

What is the problem with allowing infinitely
many particles in a field theory?
**** Answer:
The Hilbert space required becomes too big, as a
result there will be unitarily inequivalent 
representations of the creation and annihilation
operators on the space. As a consequence, 
counting particles with the density operator
will give different results in different
representations. (Maybe just what is needed

Where does the idea that
quantum states interact
via particles come from?
**** Answer:
This is from the modelling
of interaction amplitudes 
as Taylor series in /⟨a|Hⁿ|b⟩/.
Writing the second order
coefficient in terms of matrix
elements,
/⟨a|H²|b⟩=∑⟨a|H|γ⟩⟨γ|H|b⟩/
with intermediary states
/γ/, these states play the
role of interaction particles,
ie /b/ turns into /a/ with amplitude
/⟨a|H²|b⟩/ via the intermediary
/γ/.

How is the density
matrix used in a 
measurement?
**** Answer:
To obtain the total
expectation of an operator
from the expectations of
the pure states as
/⟨A⟩=∑pⱼ⟨φⱼ|A|φⱼ⟩/, which
can be written as
/tr(ρA)/ with density matrix
/ρ=∑pⱼ|φⱼ⟩⟨φⱼ|/.

Are trace functions
/f/ from density operators
/ρ=∫dx f(x)|φₓ⟩⟨φₓ|/ always
probability distributions?
**** Answer:
Not if the system /|φₓ⟩/ is
overcomplete, in that case,
/f/ may be only a quasi-probability
distribution. The only guarantee
is /tr(ρ)=∫dx f(x)=1/.

In a sense that a vector is
lifted out of its tangent
space and then moved through
an ambient space introducing
ambiguity, before being
projected back into another
tangent space resulting in
a collapse of the ambiguity.

How to derive the 
velocity operator?
**** Answer:
Use /v=∂ₜx/ on the
expectation /⟨x̂⟩/
of position, ie
/∂ₜ⟨x̂⟩=∂ₜ∫dxφ*(x,t)x̂φ(x,t)/
and differentiate under
the integral. Then use
the Schrödinger equation
to replace /∂ₜ/ and obtain
v̂=1/(iℏ)[x̂,H] as velocity
operator.

Why can a beam splitter
be modeled as

**** Answer:
With /|x⟩₁/ denoting the 
number of particles coming
in from the left, /|y⟩₃/ the
number of particles departing
to the top and /|y⟩₄/ those
departing to the right, /|y⟩₃/
represents reflection and /|y⟩₄/
transmission. For particles /|x⟩₂/
entering from the bottom, /|y⟩₃/
represents transmission whereas
/|y⟩₄/ represents reflection.

From the requirement that

/|x⟩₁↦ρ|y⟩₃+τ|y⟩₄/,
be unitary, which requires

How does a beam splitter
give rise to an operator?
**** Answer:
A beam splitter is a device
with two inputs and two 
outputs. It transforms incoming
electric fields /E₁/, /E₂/ into
output fields /E₃/, /E₄/ via
/E₁ → τE₃+ρE₄/ and 
/E₂ → ρE₃+τE₄/
with reflection and transmission
amplitudes /ρ, τ/. If the splitter
is lossless, this is a unitary
transformation.

How can a two component wave
function /ψ=(α,β)ᵀ/ be interpreted
in terms of probabilities?
**** Answer:
This is interpreted as the wave
function of a spin-½ particle whose
component /α/ is the probability amplitude
for the particle in the spin-up state
whereas component /β/ is the probability
amplitude for the particle in the 
spin-down state. So the wave functions
correspond to conditional probabilities.

**** Answer:

are spin-½ particles, each of them has
two components representing spin-up 
and spin-down states thus leading to
four components overall.

How come the usual interpretation

Because the probability density
interpretation is derived from

probability flux /J/. Here,
this turns out to be
/ρ=i(ψ̄∂ₜψ-ψ∂ₜψ̄)/.The form /ρ=|ψ|²/

Why is the definition of
/charge/ confusing?
**** Answer:
Because only particles that
are their own anti-particles
can be eigenvalues of the 
charge operator. But this means
their electrical charge must
be 0.

How does the identity of particle
types come about?
**** Answer:
Through observables whose eigenstates
are energy eigenstates but with few
eigenvalues, such as electric charge,
parity etc. This way, these properties
won't change in time, thus conveying
individuality through durability. The
low number of eigenvalues avoids 
the confusion of multitudes.

Why does beta decay
/n → p+e+v̄ₑ/ involve an
anti-neutrino instead
of a neutrino?
**** Answer:
Because lepton number has
to be preserved. Neutron
/n/ and proton /p/ both have 
lepton number 0 as
non-leptons whereas the 
electron has lepton number 1.
Thus, the neutrino part needs
to have lepton number -1 requiring
it to be an anti-neutrino.

What is the idea of using the path-integral
to describe 
$I=\langle q_F|e^{-iHT}|q_I\rangle$?
**** Answer:
To split the $T$ into shorter intervals
$\delta t$ and then write 
$e^{-iHT}=\prod e^{-iH\delta t}$. This
then allows to split up $I$ into a sum
of products of intermediate state changes
$\langle q_{j+1}|e^{-iH\delta t}|q_j\rangle$
using the fact that the $q_j$ form an 
orthonormal system. The hope is that the
intermediate state changes are easier to
obtain and make sense in the limit as
$\delta t\rightarrow 0$.

more precisely as time-integral of /L/, 
also called the action. In addition, for
/ℏ → 0/ the classical path

How does reality creation
by interaction tie in with
the existence of a
noumenon?
**** Answer:
There must be a feature
all observers agree on
after an interaction, just
like the speed of light
in relativistic measurements.
This feature should be related
to the noumenon.

Why is /lack of reality/
not a strong argument
against Wigner's subjective
theory of wave-function
collapse?
**** Answer:
Because even if different
observers have their own
reality (=phenomenology),
these realities need not
be arbitrary. It takes
only one perception they
agree on to translate between
the phenomenologies, as
happens with observers in
relativity who all perceive
the same speed of light.

Why is the Poisson bracket
difficult to accomodate in
quantization procedures?
**** Answer:
Because the requirements
that /n↦Qₙ/ be linear and
/[Qₙ,Qₘ]=iℏ Q_{n,m}/ with
Poisson bracket /{n,m}/ are
inconsistent with the usual
quantization where position
is the multiplication 
operator and momentum is
/-iℏ∂ₓ/.

Is there any leeway in the form of
the quantum hamiltonian /H/ in the

**** Answer:
The form of /H/ is derived as the linear part
of the unitary time evolution operator 
/U(t',t)/ as /U(t',t)~1-iH(t'-t)/ using the
Taylor expansion. Using the correpondence
principle it can be shown that in the classical
limit the expectation of /H/ is the energy.
However, due to the uncertainty principle, the
form of the hamiltonian /H/ is not completetely
determined by the correspondence principle.

Is there a way to derive the
Schrödinger equation without
recourse to the form of definite
energy-state wave-functions?
**** Answer:
Yes, the linearity of quantum
mechanics leads to the requirement
of /ψ(t')=U(t',t)ψ(t)/ with /U(t',t)/
a unitary operator for the change
of state from /t/ to /t'/. Taylor expansion
to first order leads to 
/U(t',t)~1-iH(t'-t)/ with /H/ hermitian and
in the limit /t'→ t/ to the Schrödinger
equation with /H/. Checking expectation
values for /H/ and using the correspondence
principle shows that the expectation
of /H/ is the classical energy.

**** Answer:
A property of two signals
reminiscent of correlation. It
compares average cross-correlation
/Sᵤᵥ/ of signals /u(t), v(t)/ to their
average autocorrelations /Sᵤᵤ, Sᵥᵥ/
and is defined as
/γᵤᵥ(f) = |Sᵤᵥ(f)|²/(Sᵤᵤ(f)Sᵥᵥ(f))/
where /Sᵤᵤ(f)/ is the Fourier 
transform of the autocorrelation
of signal /u(t)/ and similarly
for /Sᵥᵥ(f)/ and /v(t)/. /Sᵤᵥ(f)/ 
is the Fourier transform of the 
crosscorrelation of signals 
/u(t), v(t)/.

Why does the

It requires hardware support

Check if there is a brightness

~sudo find /sys -type f -iname '*brightness*'.~
If so, link an entry in =/sys/class/backlight=
to it, if not then there is no hardware
support for brightness changes.

Why is it not a good
idea to copy system directories
from one partition to another,

Because copying doesn't keep file
ownership intact. This may break
applications requiring write access
to certain areas of ie /var.

That was removed in the transition

its dbus-service configuration, the

had to be removed by hand to make

~Exec=/bin/false~ to reflect the fact
that the original systemd-shim

often not upgrade the kernel?
**** Answer:
Kernel upgrades usually come
as a new package which is a new
dependency of the kernel
meta-package. As such, it will not
be installed by =apt-get upgrade=
until the meta-package is upgraded,
it needs =apt-get dist-upgrade=
to be run.

How to fool a package
such as android-tools-adb
to think it stopped its
init.d service?
**** Answer:
Put a symbolic link from
~/lib/systemd/system/android-tools-adbd.service~
to ~/dev/null~. The pre-removal
script for android-tools-adb calls 
~invoke-rc.d android-tools-adbd stop~
which will now succeed with this link.
Note this has been an issue with systems
changing their init procedures, such as 
ubuntu between 16 and 18, where it was
hard to update this package because the 
old version couldn't be removed.

How to configure xmonad
to exhibit the network
connection icon?
**** Answer:
Install ~xmobar~ or something
equivalent and ~stalonetray~.
Then ~spawn "stalonetray"~ in
the ~startupHook~ in xmonad.hs.
If ~nm-applet~ is already running
(i.e. due to an lxsession or 
some such), this will bring up
the network icon. Otherwise
spawn nm-applet as well, 
presumably before stalonetray.
