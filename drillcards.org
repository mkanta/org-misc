What is the problem when variables
in the /varlist/ of a =let= have value
/nil/ even though values were assigned to them?
**** Answer:
Check for proper parenthesing: the /varlist/ 
can contain variablenames and =(variable value)=
pairs, only in the latter case is the =variable=
asigned a value. A list of the form 
=(symbol1 symbol2)= creates two variables names 
=symbol1= and =symbol2= with values =nil=, 
not a variable name =symbol1= with value 
=symbol2=.

What is the difference between =funcall= 
and =apply=?
**** Answer:
They are both used to call functions, the
only difference is how arguments are handled.
Whilst =funcall= treats the arguments after the 
function as arguments of the function, =apply=
inserts them into the list given by the last 
argument.

What turns javascript variables declared
 with /var/ into a minefield for the normal
programmer?
**** Answer
The fact that they are not block-scoped but
function scoped. Thus, a variable declared in
a loop will be visible even before the loop
in its ambient function. This leads to 
unexpected behaviour. In addition, it is 
possible to make a /var/ declaration
several times with the same variable.

Can the /for .. of/ loop be used to
iterate over objects?
**** Answer
If the specification is ES6
or higher. For TypeScript generating
javascript for ES5 or lower, the object 
needs to have a /length/ property for this 
to work because the generated code
is a classical for loop with an index
variable.

Is there a way to achieve nominal typing in
typescript?
**** Answer:
Since /enum/s are nominally typed, define a
dedicated /enum/ for a type and form the 
intersection of the two. Note that this does
not work if the type is a /number/ because 
/enum/'s are compatible with /number/.

**** Answer:
This turns a variable of any type into a

that a single =!= negates the /truthy/ value 
of the variable into a /boolean truth/ value
and a second one negates it back in the 
opposite /boolean truth/ value.

In which way differs constructor naming in
typescript from languages like C++ or Java?
**** Answer:
The name of the constructor is always 
=constructor= rather than the class name 
as in C++ or Java.

Do all members of a class have to be initialised
through the class constructor?
**** Answer:
No, any member can be initialised outside
the constructor, which is often used for
defaults. In fact, a constructor isn't even
necessary.

Why can functions defined as members rather
than methods not have the same name in a 
derived class and its base class?
**** Answer:
Because they must be accessed through /this/.
Since the /this/ of the derived class contains
the members of the derived class and those of
the base class, having the same name would 
lead to conflicts.

What is the rationale behind the mutable /this/
pointer of functions defined as members in 
javascript objects?
**** Answer:
The fact that functions used as callbacks 
sometimes need the context of the caller 
combined with the ease of obtaining the 
context of the defining object through the
use of closures, ie. the =that = this= method.

What is the difference between defining a 
function as a member of a class via the 
/function/ keyword and the fat arrow lambda
notation?
**** Answer:
The value of /this/ is different. Defining
=this.funcname = function(...){...}= sets /this/
to the calling context of whoever calls 
=objname.funcname()=. On the other hand, with
=this.funcname = (...) => {...}=, =this= always
refers to the =this= of the defining context, 
no matter who calls =objname.funcname=.

Why can a vector field
be considered a differential
operator?
**** Answer:
Because it can be viewed as
a field of directional 
derivatives. As such, it
assigns to every sufficiently
smooth function a field of
directional derivatives, an
assignment that can be expressed
as a differential operator.

What is the problem when trying to define a 
derivative of vector fields on a manifold?
**** Answer:
In most cases the difference /v(x+hw)-v(x)/
doesn't make sense because the vectors
involved are not in the same tangent space.
Using coordinate-wise differences doesn't 
help because it makes the
result dependent on the choice of 
coordimate system.

What is the geometric idea of calculating
the covariant derivative of a vector field?
**** Answer:
To calculate the derivative of the vector
field at /x/, the vector /v(x+tw)/ undergoes
a parallel transport into the tangent
space at /x/ and is compared to /v(x)/.

of tangent vectors on a manifold as used
in the calculation of the covariant

space is used, where parallel transport is 
well defined. The vectors are transported in
the ambient space and projected onto the tangent
spaces of the manifold.

How does a (proper) Lorentz 
transformation /Λ/
affect field operators /Φ(x)/?
**** Answer:
/Φ(x) → U(Λ)Φ(x)U(Λ⁻¹)/ where 
/U(Λ)/ is the unitary operator
representing /Λ/ on the 
Hilbert space on which /Φ(x)/ 
is defined.

Why does beta decay
/n → p+e+v̄ₑ/ involve an
anti-neutrino instead
of a neutrino?
**** Answer:
Because lepton number has
to be preserved. Neutron
/n/ and proton /p/ both have 
lepton number 0 as
non-leptons whereas the 
electron has lepton number 1.
Thus, the neutrino part needs
to have lepton number -1 requiring
it to be an anti-neutrino.

However, representations related to imaginary 
masses and continuous spin are discarded as

**** Answer:
Because the irreducible representations of the

corresponding to /m>0/ can have only spins of 
integer and half-integer values. Thus, for 
positive mass the representations can be 
described in terms of wave-equations.

Why is the description of a quantum field
theory in terms of creation and annihilation
operators on a Hilbert space the natural 
thing to do?
**** Answer:
Because of its relationship with measurements
which consist of counting particles, be it
with Geiger counters or in particle accelerators.
The composition /vₖ=uₖ⁺uₖ/ of a creation
with an annihilation operator results in a counting
operator which counts the number of particles of
a given type in a given state.

**** Answer:
The Hilbert space required becomes too big, as a
result there will be unitarily inequivalent 
representations of the creation and annihilation
operators on the space. As a consequence, 
counting particles with the density operator
will give different results in different
representations.

$e^{-iHT}=\prod e^{-iH\delta t}$. This
then allows to split up $I$ into a sum
of products of intermediate state changes
$\langle q_{j+1}|e^{-iH\delta t}|q_j\rangle$
using the fact that the $q_j$ form an 
orthonormal system. The hope is that the
intermediate state changes are easier to
obtain and make sense in the limit as
$\delta t\rightarrow 0$.

Why is the path-integral formulation 
commonly accepted despite its computational
difficulty?
**** Answer:
Because, for many frequently occuring 
Hamiltonians /H/ it can be expressed in
terms of the corresponding Lagrangian /L/,
more precisely as time-integral of /L/, 
also called the action. In addition, for
/ℏ → 0/ the classical path
is obtained.

How does the propagator arise?
**** Answer:
For a disturbance /J(x)/ in the field, 
the path integral is /Z=Ceⁱᵂ⁽ᴶ⁾/ with a
constant /C/ and a quadratic form
/W(J)=-1/2∫∫ dx dy J(x)D(x-y)J(y)/
where /D/ is the propagator.

How is the propagator related to its
field?
**** Answer:
The propagator /D/ must satisfy 
/-OD(x-y)=δ(x-y)/ where /O/
is the differential operator resulting
from the equations of motion of the 
Lagrangian of the field, ie it is the 
inverse of that operator.

How do the propagators for the Gordon-Klein
field differ from those of the electromagnetic
field?
**** Answer:
The propagator in the Gordon-Klein field is
a scalar because this field is a scalar field.
The propagator in the electromagnetic field
is a matrix because the electromagnetic
field is a vector field resulting from
its vector potential.

Why is /lack of reality/
not a strong argument
against Wigner's subjective
theory of wave-function
collapse?
**** Answer:
Because even if different
observers have their own
reality (=phenomenology),
these realities need not
be arbitrary. It takes
only one perception they
agree on to translate between
the phenomenologies, as
happens with observers in
relativity who all perceive
the same speed of light.
