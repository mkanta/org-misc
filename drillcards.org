What is the problem when variables
in the /varlist/ of a =let= have value
/nil/ even though values were assigned to them?
**** Answer:
Check for proper parenthesing: the /varlist/ 
can contain variablenames and =(variable value)=
pairs, only in the latter case is the =variable=
asigned a value. A list of the form 
=(symbol1 symbol2)= creates two variables names 
=symbol1= and =symbol2= with values =nil=, 
not a variable name =symbol1= with value 
=symbol2=.

What turns javascript variables declared
 with /var/ into a minefield for the normal
programmer?
**** Answer
The fact that they are not block-scoped but
function scoped. Thus, a variable declared in
a loop will be visible even before the loop
in its ambient function. This leads to 
unexpected behaviour. In addition, it is 
possible to make a /var/ declaration
several times with the same variable.

Can the /for .. of/ loop be used to
iterate over objects?
**** Answer
If the specification is ES6
or higher. For TypeScript generating
javascript for ES5 or lower, the object 
needs to have a /length/ property for this 
to work because the generated code
is a classical for loop with an index
variable.

Is there a way to achieve nominal typing in
typescript?
**** Answer:
Since /enum/s are nominally typed, define a
dedicated /enum/ for a type and form the 
intersection of the two. Note that this does
not work if the type is a /number/ because 
/enum/'s are compatible with /number/.

with name /varname/?
**** Answer:
This turns a variable of any type into a
/boolean/ with its proper truth value. Note
that a single =!= negates the /truthy/ value 
of the variable into a /boolean truth/ value
and a second one negates it back in the 
opposite /boolean truth/ value.

Why can functions defined as members rather
than methods not have the same name in a 
derived class and its base class?
**** Answer:
Because they must be accessed through /this/.
Since the /this/ of the derived class contains
the members of the derived class and those of
the base class, having the same name would 
lead to conflicts.

pointer of functions defined as members in

The fact that functions used as callbacks 
sometimes need the context of the caller 
combined with the ease of obtaining the

use of closures, ie. the =that = this= method.

What is the difference between defining a 
function as a member of a class via the 
/function/ keyword and the fat arrow lambda
notation?
**** Answer:
The value of /this/ is different. Defining
=this.funcname = function(...){...}= sets /this/
to the calling context of whoever calls 
=objname.funcname()=. On the other hand, with
=this.funcname = (...) => {...}=, =this= always
refers to the =this= of the defining context, 
no matter who calls =objname.funcname=.

In which sense do bounded operators
on a Hilbert space resemble complex
numbers?
**** Answer:
Every bounded operator can be written
as /Z=X+iY/ with unique self adjoint 
operators /X, Y/. 
Thus, bounded operators are 
like complex numbers with self adjoint
operators playing the role of real
numbers.

Why is /A ⊢ B/ not the same
as /⊢ A → B/?
**** Answer:
Because it means /B/ can be 
deduced from /A/ independently
of the logic used. The implication
arrow is tied to the logic used
and may not even be available in
a given logic. For example, in
linear logic /A ⊢ B/ means 
/⊢ A ⊸ B/, there is no /→/.

Why are events with 
/Δs²>0/ called /space-like/?
**** Answer:
Because this means that the
spatial separation exceeds the
distance light travels, thus
different space-like events must
occur at different places, ie they
are separated by space.

How to handle particles
in a relativistic context?
**** Answer:
Every relativistic observer
has a different view of the
evolution of a particle, so
each observer has its own 
Hamiltonian. If these 
Hamiltonians have some 
algebraic structure, their
irreducible representations
would qualify as particle 
representations. Especially
if they turn out to be the
same as those of the Lorentz
group.

Could particles be defined as
eigenstates of some space-time
operator instead of a Hamiltonian?
**** Answer:
Possibly, by summarizing the
different Hamiltonians of 
different relativistic observers,
look at the irreducible representations
obtained from their structure and 
then constructing on operator from
that, such as the Casimir operator, 
possibly also employing the relevant
Lorentz group.

In which sense are fermion
fields less uncertain than
boson fields?
**** Answer:
There is less uncertainty
in the particle number
because in fermion fields
states /|n⟩/, /n∈{0,1}/ rather
than /n∈ℕ/. Thus, coherent
states are superpositions
of only /|0⟩, |1⟩/ rather
than superpositions of an
infinite number of particle

Since they relate to the irreducible representations

/m/ and /s/ commonly related to mass and spin. 
However, representations related to imaginary 
masses and continuous spin are discarded as
unphysical.

wave equations ?
**** Answer:
Because the irreducible representations of the 
(proper) Lorentz group on the Hilbert space 
corresponding to /m>0/ can have only spins of 
integer and half-integer values. Thus, for 
positive mass the representations can be 
described in terms of wave-equations.

Why is the description of a quantum field
theory in terms of creation and annihilation
operators on a Hilbert space the natural 
thing to do?
**** Answer:
Because of its relationship with measurements
which consist of counting particles, be it
with Geiger counters or in particle accelerators.
The composition /vₖ=uₖ⁺uₖ/ of a creation
with an annihilation operator results in a counting
operator which counts the number of particles of
a given type in a given state.

What is the problem with allowing infinitely
many particles in a field theory?
**** Answer:
The Hilbert space required becomes too big, as a
result there will be unitarily inequivalent 
representations of the creation and annihilation
operators on the space. As a consequence, 
counting particles with the density operator
will give different results in different
representations.

How come the usual interpretation
of /|ψ|²/ as probability density
fails for the solutions /ψ/
of the Klein-Gordon equation?
**** Answer:
Because the probability density
interpretation is derived from
/conservation of probability/
/∂ₜρ+∇J=0/ with density /ρ/ and 
probability flux /J/. Here,
this turns out to be
/ρ=i(ψ̄∂ₜψ-ψ∂ₜψ̄)/.The form /ρ=|ψ|²/ 
is particular to the 
Schrödinger equation.

How can wave functions /ψ/
be associated with probability 
distributions?
**** Answer:
Via the probability current
/J=ℏ/2mi(ψ̄∇ψ-ψ∇ψ̄)/ and conservation
of probability /∂ₜρ+∇J=0/. With the
proper wave equation, the solution
can be as simple as /ρ=|ψ|²/ as in the
case of the Schrödinger equation.

**** Answer:
This form of the probability current
is only valid for free spin-0 particles.
It has to be adjusted for field and 
spin interactions in other cases.

Why is the appearance of negative
probability distributions not the
real problem of the Klein-Gordon
equation?
**** Answer:
Because they could be explained
away as positive probabilities for
anti-particles. The real problem 
seems that for free energy solutions
the distributions /ρ=i(ψ̄∂ₜψ-ψ∂ₜψ̄)=2E/
are uniform. (Same as Schrödinger?)

How does the identity of particle
types come about?
**** Answer:
Through observables whose eigenstates
are energy eigenstates but with few
eigenvalues, such as electric charge,
parity etc. This way, these properties
won't change in time, thus conveying
individuality through durability. The
low number of eigenvalues avoids 
the confusion of multitudes.

Why does beta decay
/n → p+e+v̄ₑ/ involve an

**** Answer:
Because lepton number has
to be preserved. Neutron
/n/ and proton /p/ both have 
lepton number 0 as
non-leptons whereas the 
electron has lepton number 1.
Thus, the neutrino part needs
to have lepton number -1 requiring

What is the idea of using the path-integral
to describe 
$I=\langle q_F|e^{-iHT}|q_I\rangle$?
**** Answer:
To split the $T$ into shorter intervals
$\delta t$ and then write 
$e^{-iHT}=\prod e^{-iH\delta t}$. This
then allows to split up $I$ into a sum
of products of intermediate state changes
$\langle q_{j+1}|e^{-iH\delta t}|q_j\rangle$
using the fact that the $q_j$ form an 
orthonormal system. The hope is that the
intermediate state changes are easier to
obtain and make sense in the limit as
$\delta t\rightarrow 0$.

Why is the path-integral formulation 
commonly accepted despite its computational
difficulty?
**** Answer:
Because, for many frequently occuring 
Hamiltonians /H/ it can be expressed in
terms of the corresponding Lagrangian /L/,
more precisely as time-integral of /L/, 
also called the action. In addition, for
/ℏ → 0/ the classical path
is obtained.

How does the propagator arise?
**** Answer:
For a disturbance /J(x)/ in the field, 
the path integral is /Z=Ceⁱᵂ⁽ᴶ⁾/ with a
constant /C/ and a quadratic form
/W(J)=-1/2∫∫ dx dy J(x)D(x-y)J(y)/
where /D/ is the propagator.

How is the propagator related to its
field?

The propagator /D/ must satisfy 
/-OD(x-y)=δ(x-y)/ where /O/
is the differential operator resulting
from the equations of motion of the 
Lagrangian of the field, ie it is the 
inverse of that operator.

How do the propagators for the Gordon-Klein
field differ from those of the electromagnetic
field?

The propagator in the Gordon-Klein field is
a scalar because this field is a scalar field.
The propagator in the electromagnetic field
is a matrix because the electromagnetic
field is a vector field resulting from
its vector potential.

Why is /lack of reality/
not a strong argument
against Wigner's subjective
theory of wave-function
collapse?
**** Answer:
Because even if different
observers have their own
reality (=phenomenology),
these realities need not
be arbitrary. It takes
only one perception they
agree on to translate between
the phenomenologies, as
happens with observers in
relativity who all perceive
the same speed of light.

Is there any leeway in the form of
the quantum hamiltonian /H/ in the 
Schrödinger equation?
**** Answer:
The form of /H/ is derived as the linear part
of the unitary time evolution operator 
/U(t',t)/ as /U(t',t)~1-iH(t'-t)/ using the
Taylor expansion. Using the correpondence
principle it can be shown that in the classical
limit the expectation of /H/ is the energy.
However, due to the uncertainty principle, the
form of the hamiltonian /H/ is not completetely
determined by the correspondence principle.

Is there a way to derive the
Schrödinger equation without
recourse to the form of definite
energy-state wave-functions?
**** Answer:
Yes, the linearity of quantum
mechanics leads to the requirement
of /ψ(t')=U(t',t)ψ(t)/ with /U(t',t)/
a unitary operator for the change
of state from /t/ to /t'/. Taylor expansion
to first order leads to 
/U(t',t)~1-iH(t'-t)/ with /H/ hermitian and
in the limit /t'→ t/ to the Schrödinger
equation with /H/. Checking expectation
values for /H/ and using the correspondence
principle shows that the expectation
of /H/ is the classical energy.
