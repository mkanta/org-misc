**** Answer:
There is a chance the app is
an administrator. Go to

and see if it is listed there. If so,
check its box and deactivate it. Reboot
and it should be uninstallable in
the usual way.

What's the main problem
with formatting SD-cards

**** Answer:
Speed, because SD-cards 
are slower than internal
memory. If buying an
SD-card to boost internal
memory, make sure it is
high-speed, ie UHS-1 type
or better.

What are the consequences of
formatting an SD-card as 
internal on Android 6.0+?
**** Answer:
After migrating data, the
removal of the SD-card will
break applications that moved
their data to the SD-card
unless the data are moved back.
Thus, SD-cards formatted in
this way aren't meant to be
swapping in and out of the 
device.

What is the rap on
the =do:...=
expressions in elixir?
**** Answer:
These are actually 
keyword lists
and equivalent to
=[{:do,...}]=, which can
be rewritten as
=[do: ...]= due to some
syntactic sugar. If the 
keyword list is the last
argument of a function, the
square brackets can be
dropped and =do:...=
is the result.

important in Elixir?
**** Answer:
Because of piping, where

of the function call that is
next in the pipe.

Why is the fudge with
the =.()= notation for
anonymous functions
needed in elixir?
**** Answer:
Probably because arguments
can be permuted in anonymous
functions defined by a capture,
which needs to sort out the
=&1, &2,...= etc.

with the elixir
expression
=(&(&1 * 2).(5))=?
**** Answer:
According to /iex/, 
this is a function of
arity =1=, but applying
an anonymous arguments 
to it as in
=(&(&1 * 2).(5)).(2)=
is accepted by the
compiler but results
in a run-time error
/BadFunctionError/, complaining
about expecting a function

the elixir pipe
=1 |> &(&1 * 2).()=?
**** Answer:
Elixir syntax quirks:
need extra parentheses:
=1 |> (&(&1 * 2)).().
to make this work. 
According to /iex/,
=&(&1 * 2).(1)= is 
still a function.

This evaluates the product

Why is piping actually
not such a great idea
for Elixir?
**** Answer:
Because Elixir aims to
be functional but piping
is imperative and should
be restricted to something
like monads.
In addition, it causes a 
lot of bad design decisions, 
such as function capturing 
and =.()=.

How to pipe something into
the second argument of a
function =Foo.bar/2=?
**** Answer:
With a capture

where =arg1= is a constant for
the first argument. So
=Foo.bar= is called as
=Foo.bar(arg1,val)=.

How are minor modes
disabled interactively?
**** Answer:
Normally by calling the
minor mode function:
~M-x some-mode-function-mode~
because minor mode functions
should be written to toggle
the mode if called interactively
without a prefix argument. 
Alternatively, call the minor 
mode function with a negative 
prefix argument to disable it, 
with a positive one to enable 
it.

**** Answer:
This is for functions to be run
whenever a ~revert-buffer~ event
occurs. Note that these functions
should not cause a ~revert-buffer~,
otherwise an infinite recursion
would occur.

What is the problem when variables
in the /varlist/ of a =let= have value
/nil/ even though values were assigned to them?
**** Answer:
Check for proper parenthesing: the /varlist/ 
can contain variablenames and =(variable value)=
pairs, only in the latter case is the =variable=
asigned a value. A list of the form 
=(symbol1 symbol2)= creates two variables names 
=symbol1= and =symbol2= with values =nil=, 
not a variable name =symbol1= with value 
=symbol2=.

The widget-name and class

styling. In addition,
they appear in the

~widgetPath~ output.
The window id is 
merely used to extract
widgets from the builder.

Is there a better way to
turn off overloaded labels
in haskell-gi apart from
setting the flag for every
library involved?
**** Answer:
The flag-setting procedure
is depreciated as of
haskell-gi-0.21. Just list
=haskell-gi-overloading-0.0=
under ~extra-deps~ in the
stack.yaml file.

This allows some abbreviations

~widgetDoSomething w arg1 arg2 ...~
becomes
~#doSomething w arg1 arg2 ...~
where the ~#~ is set according
to the type of ~w~.

the Gtk bindings with
regards to type safety?
**** Answer:
The fact that the success of

types is only ascertained
at run-time. There should
be a mechanism like with the
persistent database where
*.glade files are analysed at
compile time like database
content, as well as the
types of new widgets.

Why is packing values
into a list with
something like
=flip (:) [] :: a -> [a]=
not such a superb idea?
**** Answer:
Because something like
~pure :: a->[] a~ or
~return :: a-> [] a~ seems
more appropriate since
list are both applicative
and monads. Called in the
right context, the type
annotations aren't even
necessary.

How to download sources
of a package?
**** Answer:
~stack unpack <package> --to <directory>~
will create <directory>/<package> and put
the source of <package> in it. Note the
<package> can then be built using
the usual ~stack init~, ~stack build~
sequence.

How to prevent heavy
downloads in a new stack project?
**** Answer:
By running
~stack init --resolver <resolver>~
with an existing /<resolver>/. This
way, the resolver packages don't 
need to be downloaded and an
existing compiler will be used,
rather than installed by
~stack build~.

Normally nothing, it just

and is discouraged.

How to install something
like /H/ globally with stack?
**** Answer:
Since /H/ calls /ghci/ and loads
some modules, these dependencies
probably need to be listed in
the ~extra-deps~ of the global
configuration before doing
a global ~stack install H~.
Or they should be given as
options in =stack build= as
ie =–extra-deps <library>=.

Locally, in a project directory
with ~stack build <tool>~, or, better
yet ~stack build --copy-compiler-tool <tool>~.
This has the effect of just copying the
tool for projects using the same version
of the compiler even if the lts is
different. ~stack exec~ will then arrange
for the executables to end up in the 
correct path.

then come the argument values. Type
applications for the next rank of
variables then follow these values

What is the calling
mechanism for a rank 2
typed function in terms
of system F?
**** Answer:
After determining the type
for the type variables covered
by the outermost ~∀~, the 
resulting type is applied to
another ~Λ~ of the appropriate
type to obtain a ~λ~.

How does type selection
for rank 2 typed functions
differ from rank 1 types?
**** Answer:
For rank 1 typed functions,
the caller determines the
types, in rank 2 typed
functions, the higher type
variables are determined
by the implementation of 
the function, not its caller.

What turns javascript variables declared
 with /var/ into a minefield for the normal
programmer?
**** Answer
The fact that they are not block-scoped but
function scoped. Thus, a variable declared in
a loop will be visible even before the loop
in its ambient function. This leads to 
unexpected behaviour. In addition, it is 
possible to make a /var/ declaration
several times with the same variable.

Can the /for .. of/ loop be used to
iterate over objects?
**** Answer
If the specification is ES6
or higher. For TypeScript generating
javascript for ES5 or lower, the object 
needs to have a /length/ property for this 
to work because the generated code
is a classical for loop with an index
variable.

Is there a way to achieve nominal typing in
typescript?
**** Answer:
Since /enum/s are nominally typed, define a
dedicated /enum/ for a type and form the 
intersection of the two. Note that this does
not work if the type is a /number/ because 
/enum/'s are compatible with /number/.

This turns a variable of any type into a

and a second one negates it back in the 
opposite /boolean truth/ value.

Why can functions defined as members rather
than methods not have the same name in a 
derived class and its base class?
**** Answer:
Because they must be accessed through /this/.
Since the /this/ of the derived class contains
the members of the derived class and those of
the base class, having the same name would 
lead to conflicts.

What is the rationale behind the mutable /this/
pointer of functions defined as members in 
javascript objects?
**** Answer:
The fact that functions used as callbacks 
sometimes need the context of the caller 
combined with the ease of obtaining the 
context of the defining object through the
use of closures, ie. the =that = this= method.

What is the difference between defining a 
function as a member of a class via the 
/function/ keyword and the fat arrow lambda
notation?
**** Answer:
The value of /this/ is different. Defining
=this.funcname = function(...){...}= sets /this/
to the calling context of whoever calls 
=objname.funcname()=. On the other hand, with
=this.funcname = (...) => {...}=, =this= always
refers to the =this= of the defining context, 
no matter who calls =objname.funcname=.

How come the project
for a hakyll-driven 
github.io site has no
master branch?
**** Answer:
That's due to the workflow
whereby the master branch is
only temporary on the client.
It is fetched and checked out
just before copying the ~_site~
files to the main directory
and then deleted after pushing
the changes.

What distinguishes natural
from unnatural transformations
between functors /F, G/?
**** Answer:
In a natural transformation,
the commutativity in
/η(Y)∘F(f)=G(f)∘η(X)/ only
depends on objects 
/X, Y/ of the source
category but not on
the morphism /f/. In an
unnatural transformation
there are morphisms where
this commutativity with
/η(X), η(Y)/ is violated.

What is the algebraic structure of
/O(1,3)/ in terms of the restricted

**** Answer:
The quotient O(1,3)/SO⁺(1,3) is isomorphic
the the group spanned by time-reversal and
space-inversion. Thus, any arbitrary
Lorentz transformation is a semi-direct
product of an element of /SO⁺(1,3)/ and
a space-time inversion.

With bounded operators
resembling the complex
numbers, is there something
like the polar representation?
**** Answer:
Yes, it is called the
/Polar Decomposition/ of a
bounded operator. Every bounded
operator /T/ can be written as
/T=UA/ where /U/ is a partial
isometry and /A/ is a positive
operator such that 
/ker T=ker A=ker U/.

In which sense does the positive
operator /A/ in the polar decomposition
/T=UA/ of bounded operator /T/ play the
role of a length?
**** Answer:
/A/ is the positive square root of
/T*T=|T|²/. Since positive operators
are self adjoint, they behave in a
sense like positive real numbers, so
/|T|/ is a bit like a length.

What is the main interest
when considering containment
of permutations?
**** Answer:
The interest actually lies
with /avoidance/. A permutation
/π/ avoids /σ/ if /π/ doesn't contain
/σ/. Of interest is the number
/Sₙ(π)/, which is the number of
/n/-permutations avoiding /π/. For
every /π/ there is a constant
/c(π)/ such that /Sₙ(π)≤c(π)ⁿ/.

In terms of matrix
containment. An /nxn/ 
matrix /A/ contains a

a submatrix /D/, possibly
obtained by deleting rows
and columns, such that
/P=D/. Note that this is

**** Answer:
By treating /∂ₜ/ as a constant
and using ODE techniques to
arrive at solutions /u(x,t)/ that 
are linear combinations of
/exp(±a∂ₜ^½x)/. Expanding and
factoring out the fractional
derivative then yields the
result.

Because it can be viewed as
a field of directional 
derivatives. As such, it
assigns to every sufficiently
smooth function a field of
directional derivatives, an
assignment that can be expressed

In most cases the difference /v(x+hw)-v(x)/

Using coordinate-wise differences doesn't 
help because it makes the
result dependent on the choice of

It is used to consume resources,
ie evaluate a lazy expression
in functional programming or
make a measurement in a
quantum system.

In which sense is the use of
the tensor symbol ⊗ for the
second conjunction in linear
logic appropriate?
**** Answer:
In a quantum sense because
/A⊗B/ seems to aptly describe
the behaviour of entangled
quantum systems. Measuring
/A⊗B/ allows no conclusions
regarding the respective states 
of the components /A,B/.

Why is /A ⊢ B/ not the same
as /⊢ A → B/?
**** Answer:
Because it means /B/ can be 
deduced from /A/ independently
of the logic used. The implication
arrow is tied to the logic used
and may not even be available in
a given logic. For example, in
linear logic /A ⊢ B/ means 
/⊢ A ⊸ B/, there is no /→/.

How are non-locality
and boundary conditions
related?
**** Answer:
Boundaries may induce 
non-locality, for example
if a gas is constrained by
a boundary causing reflection
of particles back into
the gas. This creates a
dependency on previous events
and causes a nonlocality in
time.

If permutation matrices
permute the indices of
vectors, how do more general
0-1 matrices act on indices?
**** Answer:
There would be a superposition
of indices which could collapse
to a certain index. On the 
other hand, the superposition
could relate to the pre-images
of an index. So if /xₙ↦xᵢ+xⱼ/ this
would mean that /i/ and /j/ are 
preimages of /n/.
Also compare to the interpretation
of 0-1 matrices as paths connecting
nodes.

What does a major mode
make sound major as opposed
to minor?
**** Answer:
The major 3rd distance
between the 1st and 3rd
notes of the scale. The
minors only have a minor
3rd in this place.

**** Answer:
Because this means that the

distance light travels, thus
different space-like events must
occur at different places for
all observers, ie they are 
separated by space.

How to handle particles
in a relativistic context?
**** Answer:
Every relativistic observer
has a different view of the
evolution of a particle, so
each observer has its own 
Hamiltonian. If these 
Hamiltonians have some 
algebraic structure, their
irreducible representations
would qualify as particle 
representations. Especially
if they turn out to be the
same as those of the Lorentz
group.

Could particles be defined as

operator instead of a Hamiltonian?
**** Answer:
Possibly, by summarizing the
different Hamiltonians of 
different relativistic observers,
look at the irreducible representations
obtained from their structure and 
then constructing on operator from
that, such as the Casimir operator, 
possibly also employing the relevant
Lorentz group.

In which sense are fermion
fields less uncertain than
boson fields?
**** Answer:
There is less uncertainty
in the particle number
because in fermion fields
states /|n⟩/, /n∈{0,1}/ rather
than /n∈ℕ/. Thus, coherent
states are superpositions
of only /|0⟩, |1⟩/ rather
than superpositions of an
infinite number of particle
states /|n⟩, n∈ℕ/.

**** Answer:
Since they relate to the irreducible representations

/m/ and /s/ commonly related to mass and spin. 
However, representations related to imaginary 
masses and continuous spin are discarded as
unphysical.

wave equations ?
**** Answer:
Because the irreducible representations of the

corresponding to /m>0/ can have only spins of 
integer and half-integer values. Thus, for 
positive mass the representations can be 
described in terms of wave-equations.

Why is the description of a quantum field
theory in terms of creation and annihilation
operators on a Hilbert space the natural 
thing to do?
**** Answer:
Because of its relationship with measurements
which consist of counting particles, be it
with Geiger counters or in particle accelerators.
The composition /vₖ=uₖ⁺uₖ/ of a creation
with an annihilation operator results in a counting
operator which counts the number of particles of
a given type in a given state.

What is the problem with allowing infinitely
many particles in a field theory?
**** Answer:
The Hilbert space required becomes too big, as a
result there will be unitarily inequivalent 
representations of the creation and annihilation
operators on the space. As a consequence, 
counting particles with the density operator
will give different results in different
representations.

How can a two component wave
function /ψ=(α,β)ᵀ/ be interpreted
in terms of probabilities?
**** Answer:
This is interpreted as the wave
function of a spin-½ particle whose
component /α/ is the probability amplitude
for the particle in the spin-up state
whereas component /β/ is the probability
amplitude for the particle in the 
spin-down state.

What is the meaning of the four 
components in the Dirac spinors?
**** Answer:
The spinors /ψ=(u,v)ᵀ/ really describe
particle-antiparticle pairs. Since these
are spin-½ particles, each of them has
two components representing spin-up 
and spin-down states thus leading to
four components overall.

How come the usual interpretation
of /|ψ|²/ as probability density
fails for the solutions /ψ/
of the Klein-Gordon equation?
**** Answer:
Because the probability density
interpretation is derived from
/conservation of probability/
/∂ₜρ+∇J=0/ with density /ρ/ and 
probability flux /J/. Here,
this turns out to be
/ρ=i(ψ̄∂ₜψ-ψ∂ₜψ̄)/.The form /ρ=|ψ|²/ 
is particular to the 
Schrödinger equation.

be associated with probability

**** Answer:
Via the probability current
/J=ℏ/2mi(ψ̄∇ψ-ψ∇ψ̄)/ and conservation
of probability /∂ₜρ+∇J=0/. With the
proper wave equation, the solution
can be as simple as /ρ=|ψ|²/ as in the

Why is the appearance of negative
probability distributions not the
real problem of the Klein-Gordon
equation?
**** Answer:
Because they could be explained
away as positive probabilities for
anti-particles. The real problem 
seems that for free energy solutions
the distributions /ρ=i(ψ̄∂ₜψ-ψ∂ₜψ̄)=2E/
are uniform. (Same as Schrödinger?)

How does the identity of particle
types come about?
**** Answer:
Through observables whose eigenstates
are energy eigenstates but with few
eigenvalues, such as electric charge,
parity etc. This way, these properties
won't change in time, thus conveying
individuality through durability. The
low number of eigenvalues avoids 
the confusion of multitudes.

Why does beta decay
/n → p+e+v̄ₑ/ involve an
anti-neutrino instead
of a neutrino?
**** Answer:
Because lepton number has
to be preserved. Neutron
/n/ and proton /p/ both have 
lepton number 0 as
non-leptons whereas the 
electron has lepton number 1.
Thus, the neutrino part needs
to have lepton number -1 requiring
it to be an anti-neutrino.

Why can a neutral particle
like the neutrino have an 
anti-particle?
**** Answer:
Because these particles can
have a lepton number, thus 
despite being electrically 
neutral they can have opposite
lepton numbers.

What is the idea of using the path-integral
to describe 
$I=\langle q_F|e^{-iHT}|q_I\rangle$?
**** Answer:
To split the $T$ into shorter intervals
$\delta t$ and then write 
$e^{-iHT}=\prod e^{-iH\delta t}$. This
then allows to split up $I$ into a sum
of products of intermediate state changes
$\langle q_{j+1}|e^{-iH\delta t}|q_j\rangle$
using the fact that the $q_j$ form an 
orthonormal system. The hope is that the
intermediate state changes are easier to
obtain and make sense in the limit as
$\delta t\rightarrow 0$.

Why is the path-integral formulation 
commonly accepted despite its computational
difficulty?
**** Answer:
Because, for many frequently occuring 
Hamiltonians /H/ it can be expressed in
terms of the corresponding Lagrangian /L/,
more precisely as time-integral of /L/, 
also called the action. In addition, for
/ℏ → 0/ the classical path
is obtained.

How does the propagator arise?
**** Answer:
For a disturbance /J(x)/ in the field, 
the path integral is /Z=Ceⁱᵂ⁽ᴶ⁾/ with a
constant /C/ and a quadratic form
/W(J)=-1/2∫∫ dx dy J(x)D(x-y)J(y)/
where /D/ is the propagator.

Why is /lack of reality/
not a strong argument
against Wigner's subjective
theory of wave-function
collapse?
**** Answer:
Because even if different
observers have their own
reality (=phenomenology),
these realities need not
be arbitrary. It takes
only one perception they
agree on to translate between
the phenomenologies, as
happens with observers in
relativity who all perceive
the same speed of light.

Is there any leeway in the form of
the quantum hamiltonian /H/ in the 
Schrödinger equation?
**** Answer:
The form of /H/ is derived as the linear part
of the unitary time evolution operator 
/U(t',t)/ as /U(t',t)~1-iH(t'-t)/ using the
Taylor expansion. Using the correpondence
principle it can be shown that in the classical
limit the expectation of /H/ is the energy.
However, due to the uncertainty principle, the
form of the hamiltonian /H/ is not completetely
determined by the correspondence principle.

Is there a way to derive the
Schrödinger equation without
recourse to the form of definite
energy-state wave-functions?
**** Answer:
Yes, the linearity of quantum
mechanics leads to the requirement
of /ψ(t')=U(t',t)ψ(t)/ with /U(t',t)/
a unitary operator for the change
of state from /t/ to /t'/. Taylor expansion
to first order leads to 
/U(t',t)~1-iH(t'-t)/ with /H/ hermitian and
in the limit /t'→ t/ to the Schrödinger
equation with /H/. Checking expectation
values for /H/ and using the correspondence
principle shows that the expectation
of /H/ is the classical energy.

Why is it not a good
idea to copy system directories
from one partition to another,

**** Answer:
Because copying doesn't keep file
ownership intact. This may break
applications requiring write access
to certain areas of ie /var.

That was removed in the transition

its dbus-service configuration, the

had to be removed by hand to make
room for the new one, which has
~Exec=/bin/false~ to reflect the fact
that the original systemd-shim

How to fool a package
such as android-tools-adb
to think it stopped its
init.d service?
**** Answer:
Put a symbolic link from
~/lib/systemd/system/android-tools-adbd.service~
to ~/dev/null~. The pre-removal
script for android-tools-adb calls 
~invoke-rc.d android-tools-adbd stop~
which will now succeed with this link.
Note this has been an issue with systems
changing their init procedures, such as 
ubuntu between 16 and 18, where it was
hard to update this package because the 
old version couldn't be removed.

How to configure xmonad
to exhibit the network
connection icon?
**** Answer:
Install ~xmobar~ or something
equivalent and ~stalonetray~.
Then ~spawn "stalonetray"~ in
the ~startupHook~ in xmonad.hs.
If ~nm-applet~ is already running
(i.e. due to an lxsession or 
some such), this will bring up
the network icon. Otherwise
spawn nm-applet as well, 
presumably before stalonetray.

What is the difference
between using an /autostart/
file and an /autostart/
directory to start applications
at login?
**** Answer:
The /autostart/ file in
=~/.config‌/<sessionname>/$DESKTOP_SESSION=
is session specific whereas the
/autostart/ directory
=~/.config/autostart=
works for all sessions that
comply with freedesktop.org
standards.
