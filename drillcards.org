memory. If buying an
SD-card to boost internal
memory, make sure it is
high-speed, ie UHS-1 type
or better.

What are the consequences of
formatting an SD-card as 
internal on Android 6.0+?
**** Answer:
After migrating data, the
removal of the SD-card will
break applications that moved
their data to the SD-card
unless the data are moved back.
Thus, SD-cards formatted in
this way aren't meant to be
swapped in and out of the 
device.

Why is the /hour angle/
of an object of interest?
**** Answer:
It indicates the location
of the object relative
to the meridian in terms
of time. A negative value
indicates a position east
of the meridian, a positive
value one west of the 
meridian. A value of zero
means the object has reached
its highest point the sky.

Because of its relation

time equals the time of its
right ascension.

Why is reLU popular as activiation
function in deep networks?
**** Answer:
It's easy to compute gradients for,
there are no vanishing gradients,
so convergence is fast in the
network.

How does the brain behave
as a neural network?

The brain probably has steady
states as recurring cycles of
neuronal activity. There must
be an agent recognizing these
dynamical steady states, like
the state of a quantum field
corresponding to these cycles.

What is /backpropagation/
all about?
**** Answer:
This is where the loss
function /f(y,ŷ)/ of
actual label /y/ and
and predicted label /ŷ/
is optimized. It is a
function of weights, 
biases and activations
and the optimization
is usually done by a
gradient descent method
of this function.

What is the activation
function of a network layer?
**** Answer:
The evolution of a network 
layer is given by an affine 
transformation
/x↦y=Ax+b/ followed by the 
application of a nonlinear
function /f/ to its result /y/.
This function is called the 
activation function of the layer.

**** Answer:
From Mercer's theorem: If the

positive semidefinite then 
/[Tₖφ](x)=∫K(x,s)φ(s)ds/ is a linear
operator and /K/ can be written as
/K(s,t)=∑λⱼφⱼ(s)φⱼ(t)/ in terms of
eigenvectors /φᵢ/ of /Tₖ/, which
is essentially diagonalization
of /K/.

learning rate and /nᵢ/ the 
number of times the training
sample /(*xᵢ*,yᵢ)/ was misclassified
during perceptron training.

What is the effect of the 
learning rate on the hyperplane
obtained from a training run?
**** Answer:
The learning rate only affects
which training vectors become
part of the final weight vector
but not the hyperplane itself because
it will be of the form
/⟨r∑ Δᵢxᵢ,x⟩=r∑Δᵢ/, where
the /xᵢ/ are samples misclassified
during the training run.

Under which circumstances
does the learning rate have
minimal influence on the result
of perceptron training?
**** Answer:
When the initial weight vector
and the bias are zero. In that
case, the final result is of the 
form /⟨w,x⟩=b/ with
/w=r∑Δᵢxᵢ/, /b=r∑Δᵢ/, /xᵢ/ misclassified
training vectors. But multiplying
the equation of a hyperplane
by a nonzero constant doesn't
change the hyperplane.

Not at all, /cmake/ is

unix, generating buildfiles

when used on unix-like
systems it is more comparable
to /automake/ than /make/.

the =do:...=
expressions in elixir?
**** Answer:
These are actually 
keyword lists
and equivalent to
=[{:do,...}]=, which can
be rewritten as
=[do: ...]= due to some
syntactic sugar. If the 
keyword list is the last
argument of a function, the
square brackets can be
dropped and =do:...=
is the result.

Why is the fudge with
the =.()= notation for
anonymous functions
needed in elixir?
**** Answer:
Mostly because of the 
different namespaces for
functions and variables.
But also, arguments
can be permuted in anonymous
functions defined by a capture,
which needs to sort out the
=&1, &2,...= etc.

the elixir pipe
=1 |> &(&1 * 2).()=?
**** Answer:
Elixir syntax quirks:
need extra parentheses:
=1 |> (&(&1 * 2)).()=
to make this work. 
According to /iex/,
=&(&1 * 2).(1)= is 
still a function.

What happens in
the elixir expression
=(&(&1 * 2).(5)).(2)=?
**** Answer:
This evaluates the product
to =4= and then complains
that it can't apply =5=
to that result.

Why is piping actually
not such a great idea
for Elixir?
**** Answer:
Because Elixir aims to
be functional but piping
is imperative and should
be restricted to something
like monads.
In addition, it causes a 
lot of bad design decisions, 
such as function capturing 
and =.()=.

How to pipe something into
the second argument of a
function =Foo.bar/2=?
**** Answer:
With a capture 
=val |> (&Foo.bar(arg1,&1)).()=
where =arg1= is a constant for
the first argument. So
=Foo.bar= is called as
=Foo.bar(arg1,val)=.

How does /undo/
work in emacs?
**** Answer:
It operates on a stack
of operations removing
the top entry while
undoing its effect. The
next non-undo command
will add the undone
command again together
with the /undo/ operation
so that the top of the
stack now contains the
/undo/ operation.

What is the problem when variables
in the /varlist/ of a =let= have value
/nil/ even though values were assigned to them?
**** Answer:
Check for proper parenthesing: the /varlist/ 
can contain variablenames and =(variable value)=
pairs, only in the latter case is the =variable=
asigned a value. A list of the form 
=(symbol1 symbol2)= creates two variables names 
=symbol1= and =symbol2= with values =nil=, 
not a variable name =symbol1= with value 
=symbol2=.

How useful is Maxima mode in
interacting with a maxima 
process from a file?
**** Answer:
Minor maxima mode is sufficient 
for the interaction. Major maxima
mode just adds some conveniences
like syntax highlighting, identation,
access to the help system etc.

How are minor modes
disabled interactively?
**** Answer:
Normally by calling the
minor mode function:
~M-x some-mode-function-mode~
because minor mode functions
should be written to toggle
the mode if called interactively
without a prefix argument. 
Alternatively, call the minor 
mode function with a negative 
prefix argument to disable it, 
with a positive one to enable 
it.

How difficult is it to
change the tail-end factorial
function to a fixed point function?
**** Answer:
This is actually no problem
at all, just construct a λ
expression where the function
becomes the first parameter, ie
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
fact accu n = if n==0 then 1 else fact (n*accu) (n-1)
#+END_SRC
becomes
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
factaccu = \fact accu n = if n==0 then 1 else fact (n*accu) (n-1)
#+END_SRC
and tail end factorial becomes
~factorialTE = fix factaccu 1~

What happens when running

fac = \rec n -> if n==0 then 1 else n * rec (n-1)

**** Answer:
Since ~fac (fix fac) n = fix fac n~
~fix fac n~ evaluates to
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
if n==0 then 1 else n * fix fac (n-1)
#+END_SRC
which recurses down to ~fix fac 0~.

How does fixed point application
lead to recursion?
**** Answer:
For a function ~f~, ~fix f~
satisfies ~f (fix f)=fix f~. Thus,
~f~ is run with ~fix f~ as first
parameter, which, in turn, runs
~f~ with ~fix f~ as first parameter
etc.

It could be the same way as in

considered more efficient. Once
a certain complexity of the code
base is reached, its management by
imperative means may become
prohibitive.

The widget-name and class

~widgetPath~ output.
The window id is 
merely used to extract

What to do when :print
doesn't print out the 
values of variables?
**** Answer:
This is a consequence of
lazy evaluation, haskell
may not have evaluated them
yet. Use =:force= instead
of print or
=seq name ()=
where /name/ is a thunk
name, usually _tn, or
a variable name.

Because something like
~pure :: a->[] a~ or
~return :: a-> [] a~ seems
more appropriate since
list are both applicative
and monads. Called in the
right context, the type
annotations aren't even
necessary.

The fact that the success of

at run-time. There should
be a mechanism like with the
persistent database where
*.glade files are analysed at
compile time like database
content, as well as the
types of new widgets.

As of [2018-11-23], eta
needs ghc-7.10.3, whose

stack can be configured
to use that. Check for
libraries for eta on

and list them as extra
dependencies if they are 
newer than those from
lts 6.35.

Why is GADT syntax
necessary for homotopy
types?
**** Answer:
Because for a Homotopy
type, not only the type
needs to be constructed
but also equality types
over the type. Thus, control
over the return type of
constructors is needed, which
may construct elements of
equality types over the 
base type in addition to elements
of the base type. This control
is provided by GADT syntax.

are composed before the
initial value is applied.

Why is the second argument
to =failure= a set of error
items rather than just an
error item?
**** Answer:
Because the set can be
built up from alternative
parsers and is reported
as expecting alternatives
connected with /or/.

Where is error reporting
with =failure= superior to
error reporting with =fail=?
**** Answer:
When the error arises from
the syntax because =failure=
conforms to the expected-
unexpected reporting format.
On the other hand, =fail= is
free-style and should be used
if the syntax is correct but
a generated value is illegal,
perhaps out of bounds or
some such.

=fail <errorMessage>=.

What to do about unicode
being escaped in =show=
output?
**** Answer:
There is a /Text.Show.Unicode/
module but in general nothing
needs to be done because 
output into consoles with
=putStr= or =putStrLn= will
convert the escapes back into
unicode characters if the 
console supports it.

runSqlite' :: (MonadUnliftIO m) => Text

    -> m a
runSqlite' = runSqlite

because the compiler can not

Because it is a /ghci/-wrapper

=stack exec H=, which should work
if /inline-r/ is installed in the

How to install something
like /H/ globally with stack?
**** Answer:
Since /H/ calls /ghci/ and loads

probably need to be listed in

a global ~stack install H~.
Or they should be given as
options in =stack build= as
ie =–extra-deps <library>=.

from a stack project?
**** Answer:
Pass the ~--haddock-deps~
flag to the build or
test commands to generate
local documentation and run
~stack haddock --open <dependency>~,
which will open it in
a web-browser.

Why is the ~--haddock~
flag not recommended
during development?
**** Answer:
It often takes too long
and generates documentation
that needs to be updated
anyway. Use 
~--haddock-deps~ instead to
just generate local 
documentation of dependencies.

How to generate searchable
documentation for a project?
**** Answer:
Run
~stack hoogle -- generate --local~
to generate a /hoogle/ database
and start a web-server that serves
a local hoogle search page via
~stack hoogle -- server --local --port=8080~
which can be accessed at
http://localhost:8080.

How should tools like ghc-mod,
hlint, hoogle or intero be
installed?
**** Answer:
Locally, in a project directory
with ~stack build <tool>~, or, better
yet ~stack build --copy-compiler-tool <tool>~.
This has the effect of just copying the
tool for projects using the same version
of the compiler even if the lts is
different. ~stack exec~ will then arrange
for the executables to end up in the 
correct path.

development, such as
/pandoc/ but never things
like /ghc-mod/ or /intero/,
which should be sandboxed
with a project.

that the monad /Free f/
just satisfies the monad
laws and nothing else.

When are free monads used?
**** Answer:
In situations where binding
with >>= should not result
in immediate computation, as in
regular monads, but needs to
be deferred until the creator
requests a computation. Until
then, only a series of nested
contexts is built up.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data Set a where
  MkSet::Eq a => [a] -> Set a
#+END_SRC
a pattern match with =MkSet=
provides an implicit dictionary
for =Eq= whereas in the non-Gadt
version such a pattern match
would require an explicit
=Eq a= constraint. (Note that
constraints like that in the
constructor are now obsolete
and require a compiler extension.)

What does it mean to
say that an existential
datatype is the collection
of its observations?
**** Answer:
Observations are the access 
functions provided by the
constraints. For example
=Integral= provides observation
=toInteger= whereas =Num= provides
no observations at all.

type variables =a, b= if
language extension
=ScopedTypeVariables= is in
effect.

**** Answer:
Because the value of a type

variable, but only if it
is in scope.

What is the difference
between /Algebraic/ and
/Generalised Algebraic/
datatypes in terms of
the sets of their values?
**** Answer:
For /Algebraic/ datatypes
the sets of values are 
constructed as combinations
of disjoint unions and
cartesian products. For
/Generalised Algebraic/ 
datatypes, the sets of
values include fixed
points of operators on
sets as well.

What is the difference
of /Algebraic/ and

**** Answer:
In an /Algebraic/ datatype,
every constructor for the
datatype returns a value
of the same type, ie in
union types. With 
/Generalised Algebraic/ types,
different constructors can
return values of different
types.

How to get the type
out of a proxy type
variable?
**** Answer:
Normally with pattern matching.
Usually, they come wrapped in
some ~Wrapper (Proxy t)~ and can
be pattern matched as
~Wrapper (Proxy::Proxy t)~ against
the wrapper constructor. The type
variable ~t~ then becomes available
and can be used in ie. constructors.

What is the point of =Nat=
in GHC.TyeLits if it is not
recursively defined?
**** Answer:
It is meant to be used more
as a documentation type than
a recursive one. Thus, vectors
or lists with length in their
type should be constructed
from their normal counterparts
using reification and reflection
to get the length types right.
The tools for that are all in
the library.

Why will constructing a List with
typed length from input fail?
**** Answer:
Because the length is not known
at compile time, only that a
length exists. Thus, the list
with typed length needs to hide
in an existential data-type.

What is the best that can be
done with a list with typed

**** Answer:
Since the list needs to be in

functions can be applied to it
continuation style that don't
let the existential type escape.

between a closed and
an open type family?
**** Answer:
A closed type family is
defined as
=type family <Name> <variables> where=
and all definitions have to
follow the =where=. An open
type family lacks the 
=where= keyword and definitions
are provided as instances:
~type instance <Name> <variables>=...~
wherever the type family is in scope.

G is a type operator

F, on the other hand, is an
operator that produces a type
from any kind, at least if
extension =PolyKinds= is active
because in that case =k= is 
considered a kind variable.

**** Answer:
Use wildcards of the form
~@ _~ instead of a function name.
Note this also works with

How are ambiguities in the

vs its use as as-pattern
resolved?
**** Answer:

~TypeApplications~ is turned on
then a ~@~ with preceding
white-space is parsed as
type-application, otherwise
as /as-pattern/.

How are type applications
~@type~ and values ordered
in function calls using them?
**** Answer:
In rank 1 types type applications
follow the function name in left to
right order of the type variables,
then come the argument values. Type
applications for the next rank of
variables then follow these values
followed by their own values etc.

Is it possible to evaluate
~Λ~ expressions explicitly in

**** Answer:
Yes, with language extension
~TypeApplications~ this is
possible by using the ~@~
operator before the type-name. 
For example, ~read @Int~ returns
~read @Int :: String -> Int~.

differ from rank 1 types?

by the implementation of 
the function, not its caller.

What turns javascript variables declared
 with /var/ into a minefield for the normal
programmer?
**** Answer
The fact that they are not block-scoped but
function scoped. Thus, a variable declared in
a loop will be visible even before the loop
in its ambient function. This leads to 
unexpected behaviour. In addition, it is 
possible to make a /var/ declaration
several times with the same variable.

**** Answer
If the specification is ES6
or higher. For TypeScript generating
javascript for ES5 or lower, the object 
needs to have a /length/ property for this 
to work because the generated code
is a classical for loop with an index
variable.

Is there a way to achieve nominal typing in
typescript?
**** Answer:
Since /enum/s are nominally typed, define a
dedicated /enum/ for a type and form the 
intersection of the two. Note that this does
not work if the type is a /number/ because 
/enum/'s are compatible with /number/.

**** Answer:
This turns a variable of any type into a

that a single =!= negates the /truthy/ value 
of the variable into a /boolean truth/ value
and a second one negates it back in the 
opposite /boolean truth/ value.

Why can functions defined as members rather
than methods not have the same name in a

Because they must be accessed through /this/.
Since the /this/ of the derived class contains
the members of the derived class and those of
the base class, having the same name would 
lead to conflicts.

What is the difference between defining a 
function as a member of a class via the 
/function/ keyword and the fat arrow lambda
notation?
**** Answer:
The value of /this/ is different. Defining
=this.funcname = function(...){...}= sets /this/
to the calling context of whoever calls 
=objname.funcname()=. On the other hand, with
=this.funcname = (...) => {...}=, =this= always
refers to the =this= of the defining context, 
no matter who calls =objname.funcname=.

Should macros normally be 
compiled when loading them
into a root shell?
**** Answer:
Probably not, because a macro
normally lacks the includes
of header files since they are
not required by the C-interpreter.
Only if the macro needs to become
part of a standalone package is
the required effort justifiable.

What is the point of compiling
a macro with =.L filename+=
in the root shell?
**** Answer:
Execution speed, compilation
results in a dynamic library
=filenamebase.so= which is
dynamically linked into
the interpreter.

What is the blocking
behaviour when executing an
~Aff~?
**** Answer:
Expect blocking behaviour
when binding with ~>>=~. All
the other execution functions
are derived from ~forkAff~ and
are non-blocking unless
something like ~joinFiber~ is
used. Binding is implemented
as a foreign function, so it
is not immediately clear how it
actually works but it probably
amounts to a combination of
~forkAff~ with ~joinFiber~.

between using ~launchAff~

The way results are handled.
With ~launchAff~ the result will
normally obtained via ~joinFiber~
on the returned ~Fiber a~. On
the other hand, ~runAff~ takes
a callback to be run after the
fiber completes.

Where should code using the
low level purescript-web-dom
library be loaded?
**** Answer:
Normally at the end of the
body because this kind of
code usually refers to the
DOM using things like
~getElementById~, which would
return ~Nothing~ if the DOM
isn't built yet.

Is it possible to load code
using low level 
purescript-web-dom code

**** Answer:
Yes, but only if the ~defer~
attribute of the script tag
loading the code is set to
"defer". In that case, the 
code is executed only after
the DOM is built and not
when the script tag is loaded.

How to load an html
file into the browser
tab connected to a
repl?
**** Answer:
It seems like the 
index.html is as virtual
as the bundle.js file,
so the only way to do
this would be programmatically.
Starting a pulp server and
then using the fetch API to
pull in html from its url
might be the way to go.

How to load an html document
into a browser tab connected
to a purescript REPL?
**** Answer:
That depends on the browser,
but generally a CTRL-o on the
tab should bring up a file
selection dialog. Drag and
drop also works with browsers
like Chrome. Note that this
may not work as intended as
these browser tab contents
are served from a local
server and may violate the
same origin policy.

In the ~load~ listener because

be transferred outside by
calling the asynchronous
callback with it in the

Why should point-free
style as in
#+BEGIN_SRC purescript
foreign import joinPathImpl :: Fn2 FilePath FilePath FilePath

joinPath :: FilePath -> FilePath -> FilePath
joinPath = runFn2 joinPathImpl
#+END_SRC
be avoided when turning
an uncurried foreign
function into a curried
one?
**** Answer:
Because of compiler optimizations
occuring when all arguments are
present because then ~runFn2~ wouldn't
really be required. Thus,
#+BEGIN_SRC purescript
joinPath start end = runFn2 joinPathImpl start end
#+END_SRC 
would be better.

How to determine whether
a foreign function returns
an ~Effect a~ rather than
an ~a~?
**** Answer:
If the foreign implementation
returns a javascript
~function(){...}~ without an 
argument then the 
purescript equivalent returns
an ~Effect a~ where ~a~ is the 
return type of the javascript
~function(){...}~.

How to write a foreign
javascript function
returning a ~Maybe~?
**** Answer:
By passing the constructors
of ~Maybe~ as additional arguments,
for example:
#+BEGIN_SRC purescript
foreign import doSthImpl :: 
forall a. Fn4 (a -> Maybe a) (Maybe a) (a -> Boolean) a (Maybe a)
#+END_SRC
which is implemented as
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
exports.doSthImpl = function(just, nothing, fn, value) {
  if (fn(value)) {
    return just(value);
  } else {
    return nothing;
  }
};
#+END_SRC
in javascript and used as
#+BEGIN_SRC purescript
doSth :: forall a. (a -> Boolean) -> a -> Maybe a
doSth fn x = runFn4 doSthImpl Just Nothing fn x
#+END_SRC
in purescript.

Why should the functionality
from Effect.Uncurried be 
prefered when wrapping
effectful foreign javascript?
**** Answer:
It's less error-prone avoiding
nested ~return function()...~
sequences in the js file. Use
one of the ~EffectFn{N}~ types
from ~Effect.Uncurried~ when
declaring the foreign function,
which can now be implemented
directly, at least up to N=10.

Where should the results
of a computation go?
**** Answer:
While a ~div~ generally
works, the use of an
~output~ element should be
considered instead, which
is new in html5. It can
be part of a ~form~ but may
not be fully supported in
IE and Edge, where the ~form~
attribute is ignored.

What is the difference
between Actions and

**** Answer:
Actions are raised by
event sources, mostly
in the HTML and are 
internal to a component.
Queries are used for 
component interactions,
mainly between a parent
and a child.

**** Answer:
The ~eval~ function is called

~ActionC::*->*->*~ then the first
argument is related to the
event occuring. If
~ActionC::*->*~ then no argument
is passed on.

Why is it better to use
=pulp --psc-package init=
rather than just
=pulp init= and then removing

=psc-package init=?
**** Answer:
Because =pulp init= installs
some dependencies in addition
to /Prelude/ for running the
repl and in- and output. On

Only if it was initialised

In that case, just run
~pulp server~ and ignore
the recompilation errors,
it will still listen to
its configured port on

**** Answer:
In the sense that a

not inspect a polymorphic
value à la ~if (typeof val)...~
of javascript fame. The only
way to do something like that
would be via the functionality
provided by a type-class
restraining the polymorphic type.

**** Answer:
~Const a b~ is the type
level equivalent of the
function ~const~. It is used
to create a /Functor/ always
returning the type in its
first argument and ignoring
the second. Thus,
~Const Void~ is a functor always
evaluating to ~Void~.

What is the purpose of
the type row argument
in ~Eff~?
**** Answer:
To provide the context
in which the computation
may proceed. Effs with
different type row arguments
are different monads. This
seemed to be a bit like 
an alternative way to monad
transformers for building 
monad stacks.

What is the point of
the ~Foreign~ data-type
in purescript?
**** Answer:
This type represents
unchecked data from
javascript because
javascript can return
~null~ or ~undefined~ instead
of regular data without
much hesitation.

What is the deal with
foreign data-types à la
#+BEGIN_SRC purescript
foreign import data Undefined :: Type -> Type
#+END_SRC
?
**** Answer:
These are data-types whose
constructors and access functions
are defined in a foreign function
file in javascript. Javascript
functions can return them, but
they are useless on the purescript
side without any access functions
provided by the javascript side.

Why should constructors
like ~Data_Maybe.Just.create()~
generated by purescript not
be used in FFI modules to define
javascript functions returning
a ~Maybe a~?
**** Answer:
Because this depends on how
purescript generates code,
which may change in the future.
In addition, dead-code elimination
may not realise that ~Data.Maybe~ is
used here and remove it.

Why can a function
~poly::(forall a.a->a)->Boolean~
not be called with
~\n->n+1~?
**** Answer:
Because the function that
~poly~ is called with has to be
fully polymorphic whereas
the λ-expression above is
~Number->Number~. Note that 
~poly~ can be called meaningfully
only with the identity function
as this is the only unconstrained
function with signature 
~forall a.a->a~.

How to make sure that
a value can only be
~Nothing~?
**** Answer:
By requiring its type
to be the rank 2 type
~forall a.Maybe a~. This
is only satisfied by
the ~Nothing~ constructor
since ~Just value~ will
create a ~Maybe a~ where
~a~ is the type of ~value~
and thus is not fully
polymorphic.

How to use type rows
to designate record
types?
**** Answer:
Since type rows are of

~k~, they can not directly
designate record types.
They have to be in curly
brackets or assigned to
a kind variable accepting
a ~# Type~ in order to
construct a type containing
a record.

Does the function in ~Reduce~
need to have both arguments of the

**** Answer:
Only if no initial value is
given, because in that case
~Reduce(f,list)~ calculates
~f(list[1],list[2])~ in the 
first step.

**** Answer:
They are needed to apply
a function to a vector of
non-atomic values,
vectorization only works
on vectors of atomic values.

Is ~ifelse~ the only way
to have a functional
style ~if~ statement?
**** Answer:
No, its use is actually
discouraged unless the
test in ~ifelse(test,yes,no)~
actually involves a list.
If ~test~ is a simple true/false
result, use
~if(test) yes else no~,
which is more efficient.
It behaves like a function 
returning ~yes~ or ~no~.

What is the standard way
to calculate the dot product
of vectors in R?
**** Answer:
Matrix multiplication ~%*%~. It
will cast vectors to matrices
with ~as.matrix~. Note that
/⟨u,v⟩/ is usually written as
~t(u) %*% v~ because vectors are
columns by default, hence /u/ 
should be transposed to a row.

How are generic functions
implemented for S3 objects?
**** Answer:
A generic function 
~fname <- function(x,...){...}~
would call ~UseMethod("fname",x)~
which acts as sort of a dispatcher
looking for functions ~fname.xclass~
where ~xclass~ is one of the class
names of ~x~.

**** Answer:
They have to be put into
lists as in
#+BEGIN_SRC R
tlst[[1]] <- c(0.1,0.2,0.3)
tlst[[2]] <- 1
#+END_SRC
which creates a list consisting
of a vector and a value.
Note that this can be given
names.

for variance annotation in

**** Answer:
There is no equivalent because
in Haskell all types are covariant.
The problem of variance appears only
through the introduction of mutable
data, especially containers.

With a type bound ~<:~. For

expresses the requirement
that ~A~ is an instance of
~Ordered[A]~, hence comparisons
between members of ~A~ can be
performed. (Note that
/context bounds/ are more
appropriate for type
classes, a type bound would
indicate that /A/ is a 
subtype but typeclasses
are not types.)

Why are lower type bounds
needed?
**** Answer:
In cases where a type variable ~A~
is marked as covariant ~+A~ when
defining a class. This type
variable can not be used as argument
in any method of the class because
arguments are in contravariant position.
Arguments needing this type variable
need to use a type variable ~B~ instead
which has lower bound ~A~, ie ~[B >: A]~.

Why is ~<%~ often used instead
of ~<:~ for indicating type bounds?
**** Answer:
A type bound ~[A <: B]~ requires ~A~ to
extend ~B~ explicitly and often does
not work with inbuilt datatypes coming
from Java, for example. A /view bound/
~[A <% B]~ is more liberal in that respect
and only requires that ~A~ be convertible
to a ~B~, perhaps using an implicit conversion.

Why are abstract classes
needed when traits can do
the same job better?
**** Answer:
Seems mostly for interacting
with Java, which can't handle traits.
For Scala code to be callable from
Java, traits have to be wrapped
in abstract classes.

What is the difference
in the practical use of
abstract classes vs traits?
**** Answer:
Abstract classes can not be
mixed in and have to be
derived from. This is a
problem when several of
them would need to be extended.

How to make the pandoc
compiler generate output
for /MathJax/ when encountering
latex?
**** Answer:
Use ~pandocCompilerWith~ with
~writerHtmlMathMethod~ set to
~MathJax urlstring~ in its
~WriterOptions~ argument. The
~urlstring~ is a string indicating
the location of /MathJax.js/ or
the empty string.

just before copying the ~_site~

and then deleted after pushing
the changes.

to switch from the master
to a development branch

made in the master branch?
**** Answer:
Stash the changes in the 
master branch with 
~git stash~. Then switch
them to a (new) branch
with
~git stash branch <branchname>~,
this will pop the stash
into ~<branchname>~ and drop
it from master, which is
now clean.

That means there was no

branch branched off from
it, ie the current branch
is already based at HEAD
of master.

What's the problem if after
=git rebase master= the master
branch is still the same?
**** Answer:
That is to be expected,
=rebase= just changes the
topic branch to now start
at the HEAD of master. To
change /master/ a merge request
has to be issued from master.
If the =rebase= was successful, 
there will be no merge
conflicts.

then to use its /tex2svg/ command. 
Alternatively, use /dvisvgm/ to convert

What is the recommendation
on setting the owner password
in addition to the user
password on a pdf file?
**** Answer:
For keylengths 40 and 128 setting
the owner password provides some
additional security as the user
password is encrypted with the
owner password. For key-length
256, the owner password is 
mandatory as many viewers will
show the document without asking
for the user password if the 
owner password is empty.

What is the difference
between a forward and
a futures contract?
**** Answer:
A forward contract is
an agreement between two
parties to trade a
commodity sometime in the 
future at a certain price.
A future is a similar agreement
where the parties deal through
an exchange rather than directly
with each other.

How is the amount in the
margin account calculated
for a long position?
**** Answer:
There is an initial amount
to be deposited when taking
the position which is a multiple
of the futures price. Then at
the end of each trading day
the change in futures price
is multiplied by the contract
volume and credited or debited
to the account depending on whether
it went up or down.

Why should the rate of
return from capital in

**** Answer:
The historical average rate
of return from capital seems 
to be about 5%. If savings
and bonds have considerably
lower returns, the stock
market should average that
out with higher returns.

toil results in distraction
by worldly affairs and

What is the whole thing
of "born of woman" all
about in the gnostic
scriptures?
**** Answer:
This is probably a reference
to the botched creation of
humans as a result of Sophia's
separation of male and female.
Those "born of woman" are her
descendants via the demiurg and
not fully in harmony with the
dyadic creations of the Universe.

What distinguishes natural
from unnatural transformations
between functors /F, G/?
**** Answer:
In a natural transformation,
the commutativity in
/η(Y)∘F(f)=G(f)∘η(X)/ only
depends on objects 
/X, Y/ of the source
category but not on
the morphism /f/. In an
unnatural transformation
there are morphisms where
this commutativity with
/η(X), η(Y)/ is violated.

Why is the presence of
an initial object
in a category with
finite limits and colimits not
surprising?
**** Answer:
Because a finite colimit of
no object would correspond 
to a disjoint union of no
sets, hence the empty set
which is a special case of
an initial object.

**** Answer:
Terminal objects are like
one element sets, since 
there is an initial set
a terminal object should
be constructible by packing
the initial object.

Via its commutation
rules. If

a ladder operator with
shift value /c/, ie the 
eigenvalues of /NX/ are
shifted by /c/ compared
to those of /N/.

/[N,X⁺]=-cX⁺/, so /X⁺/ shifts
eigenvalues of /N/ in the
opposite direction.

eigenvalues (note /M/ is hermitian).
Then /M=(EP)*EP/, so the column
vectors /vᵢ/ (ie multiples of the

**** Answer:
Take an eigenbasis of /A/, say.
Then /B=diag(B₁,B₂,…)/ with
hermitian operators /Bᵢ/ in terms
of that basis. Since the /Bᵢ/ are
hermitian, they can be 
diagonalised separately, leading
to a common eigenbasis for
both /A/ and /B/.

are invariant under the
action of /B/, 
/B=diag(B₁,B₂,…)/ where
the /Bᵢ/ are /nᵢ×nᵢ/ matrices
with /nᵢ/ the multiplicity

Why does /P²/ generally
have more eigenvectors
than /P/?
**** Answer:
If /P/ has negative
eigenvalues /λ/, then
squaring causes degeneracy
of the corresponding
eigenspaces. Thus every
linear combinations of vectors
from /|-λ⟩/ and /|λ⟩/ is an
eigenvector of /P²/.

How can permutation matrices
be supergeneralized?
**** Answer:
By replacing the 1 entries
in permutation matrices by
nonsingular blocks. These
would be of the form 
/A=DP/ where /D/ would be
non-singular block diagonal
and /P/ would be a permutation
matrix obtained from replacing 1
entries by appropriately sized
identity matrices in a base
permutation matrix /P'/.

Why is it natural from an algebraic
point of view to consider
generalized permutation matrices
rather than merely permutation
matrices?
**** Answer:
Because they form the largest
subgroup of /GL(n,F)/ in which 
the diagonal matrices form a
normal subgroup. Here, /F/ is
the field where the entries
come from.

Since a Casimir Operator of

every element of it, its
eigenspaces are irreducible
representations of the Lie
group. Given a full set of
Casimir operators, all
irreducible representations
can be obtained this way
if the group is semisimple
and every irreducible
representation can be indexed
by the set of eigenvalues of
these Casimir operators.

a finite group /G/ the character
of a representation?
**** Answer:
No, only class functions
of the form /∑aᵢΧᵢ/ qualify
where /Xᵢ/ is the character
of irreducible representation
/Vᵢ/ and all the /aᵢ/ are 
non-negative integers. Also
note that characters are
linear functions when applied
in End(V).

What's the character of
a G-module morphism φ on
its eigenspaces?
**** Answer:
For eigenvalue /λ/ with
corresponding eigenspace /V/
the character of /φ/ on /V/ is
Χ(φ) = λ dim V
since /φ/ acts as /λe/ with
/e/ the identity on /V/.

/A/ is the positive square root of

are self adjoint, they behave in a
sense like positive real numbers, so
/|T|/ is a bit like a length.

Do the /X, Y/ in the cartesian
decomposition /Z=X+iY/ of a
bounded operator /Z/ always
commute?
**** Answer:
No, that is a feature of /normal/
operators, ie 
/XY=YX ⇔ Z is normal/.

In which sense do bounded operators
on a Hilbert space resemble complex
numbers?
**** Answer:
Every bounded operator can be written
as /Z=X+iY/ with unique self adjoint 
operators /X, Y/. 
Thus, bounded operators are 
like complex numbers with self adjoint
operators playing the role of real
numbers.

when considering containment
of permutations?
**** Answer:
The interest actually lies
with /avoidance/. A permutation
/π/ avoids /σ/ if /π/ doesn't contain
/σ/. Of interest is the number
/Sₙ(π)/, which is the number of
/n/-permutations avoiding /π/. For
every /π/ there is a constant
/c(π)/ such that /Sₙ(π)≤c(π)ⁿ/.

**** Answer:
By Kronecker substitution:
If the partial degrees of the 
multivariate polynomial 
/f(x₁,x₂,…,xₙ) are

/f̂(x,xᵈ¹,…,xᵈⁿ)/ is univariate
of degree /∏dᵢ/ or less. This map 
is monic as long as the degree
bounds are observed.

What is so special about
the difference between
kinetic and potential
energy to use it for the
Lagrangian?
**** Answer:
Viewing their respective averages
on a path as functionals on
that path it turns out
that they both change by 
the same amount when deviating 
slightly from the classical path. 
Hence, their difference remains 
constant, more precisely, the 
functional derivative
/δ/δx(t)(T[x]-V[x])=0/.

Can a signal always be
reconstructed from its
continuous wavelet transform?
**** Answer:
Yes, the admissibility
condition  /∫|Ψ(ω)|²/|ω|²<∞/
for the mother wavelet
makes sure of that.

Why are conditions in addition
to admissibility /∫|Ψ(ω)|²/|ω|²<∞/
imposed on a mother wavelet?
**** Answer:
Without additional conditions, the
product of time and bandwidth of the
corresponding wavelet transform would
be the square of the input signal,
which is undesirable in most
applications.

Is it absolutely mandatory
for a wavelet to be a wave?
**** Answer:
Yes, this is imposed by the
admissibility criterion for
its Fourier transform /Ψ(ω)/,
which requires that
/∫|Ψ(ω)|²/|ω|²<∞/. As a 
consequence, 
/Ψ(0)=∫ψ(t)dt=0/, which
implies waviness.

What's the consequence of
a function /ψ(t)/ having zero
moments up to order /n/ for its
usability as a mother wavelet?
**** Answer:
Expanding its wavelet transform
/γ(s,t)=∫f(τ)ψₛₜ(τ)dτ/ for /t=0/ and
using the Taylor expansion of /f/ at
0, it turns out that /γ(s,0)=s∑fᵖ(0)/p!Mₚsᵖ/,
so /Mₚ/ being /0/ up to /n/ makes /γ(s,0)/ disappear
as fast as /sⁿ⁺²/ for small /s/.

Where does the scaling
function come from in
wavelet analysis?
**** Answer:
The scaling function
is needed to reduce the
number of wavelet coefficients 
in a discrete wavelet transform
to a finite one by covering
the wavelet parts with scaling
factors /2ʲ/ for /j≥j₀/ for some
suitably chosen /j₀/.

Why is it normally not
possible to express a finite
signal with finitely many
wavelet coefficients without
a scaling function?
**** Answer:
Because the spectrum of a wavelet
doesn't cover the low frequencies
in the signal. Wavelets have a
spectrum like a bandpass which
becomes narrower around its centre
with increasing scaling factor
even though the centre decreases.
As a consequence, infinitely many
high scaling coefficients will be needed
unless they are covered by a lowpass
scaling function.

How to reduce the number of
wavelet coefficients to a
finite one in a wavelet
transform?
**** Answer:
By switching to a discrete
transform /ψₛₜ(x)=ψ(2ˢx-t)/
for integer /s,t/. When analysing
a finite signal, only finitely
many translations /t/ are needed.
The number of scaling parameters 
/s/ can be reduced by introducing
a scaling function /φ(x)=∑γₛₜψₛₜ(x)/
that covers the scales /s≥s₀/ for
some suitably chosen cut-off /s₀/.

How do wavelets differ from
waves?
**** Answer:
Wavelets are localised, as a
consequence position becomes
important and two parameters,
scaling and translation of
the mother wavelet are
needed to describe them. For
waves position is unimportant
due to their periodicity, so
only scaling of the mother
wave is needed for a description.

Why can a vector field
be considered a differential
operator?
**** Answer:
Because it can be viewed as
a field of directional 
derivatives. As such, it
assigns to every sufficiently
smooth function a field of
directional derivatives, an
assignment that can be expressed
as a differential operator.

Why are the partial differential

Because vector fields are linear operators
assigning to each scalar field a field 
of directional derivatives given by the
directions of the vectors in the vector field.

What is the problem when trying to define a 
derivative of vector fields on a manifold?
**** Answer:
In most cases the difference /v(x+hw)-v(x)/
doesn't make sense because the vectors
involved are not in the same tangent space.
Using coordinate-wise differences doesn't 
help because it makes the
result dependent on the choice of 
coordinate system.

What is the geometric idea of calculating
the covariant derivative of a vector field?
**** Answer:
To calculate the derivative of the vector
field at /x/, the vector /v(x+tw)/ undergoes
a parallel transport into the tangent
space at /x/ and is compared to /v(x)/.

What is the idea of parallel transport
of tangent vectors on a manifold as used
in the calculation of the covariant

**** Answer:
The embedding of the manifold in an Euclidean
space is used, where parallel transport is 
well defined. The vectors are transported in
the ambient space and projected onto the tangent
spaces of the manifold.

Why can tensors always
be represented in two
dimensions?
**** Answer:
Because there are only
two types of indices, namely
upper and lower. These
can be assigned to columns and 
rows, respectively, so any 
tensor can be represented 
recursively as a 
combination of rows or 
columns of rows or
columns.

How can tensor indices
be related to rows and
columns?
**** Answer:
In the usual notation
with vectors as columns, 
contravariant vectors
/(aⁱ)/ correspond to
column vectors and covariant
tensors /(aᵢ)/ to rows. The rest
follows from considering
higher order tensors as row
or columns of lower order
tensors according to the position
of the last index.

**** Answer:
Finite automata are

change state only upon
encountering input. Turing
machines, on the other hand,
can change state without
reading input. As a matter
of fact, internal state changes
can cause a request for more
input.

Because in its type system
=Not Not a= can not be proven.
It would correspond to type
=((a -> Void) -> Void) -> a=,
for which there is no standard
/λ/-expression.

That depends on its exact
function signature but 
essentially it proves that
a type is populated, possibly
depending on other types.

That is what fixed point

is a recursive application of
/G/ on its argument /x/.

What is the danger in the
substitution /(λy.M)[x:=N]/
where /x≠y/?
**** Answer:
If /y/ was a free variable of /N/
it would become bounded after
the substitution, which evaluates
to /λy.(M[x:=N])/. Thus, this 
requires an α-conversion of /N/ where
all free occurences of /y/ are renamed
in /N/ before the substitution can be
performed.

To provide logical connectives

and position with the classical
connectives ∧ and ∨ makes no sense in
a quantum environment, however
using ⊗ and ⅋ it might.

In which sense are
constructive logic
and linear logic not
about truth?
**** Answer:
In the sense that in
constructive logic formulas
are considered to have
a proof or not. In linear
logic, formulas are considered
resources rather than truth
bearers.

What is the difference
between a /Proposition/
/A/ and a judgement /⊢ A/?
**** Answer:
A proposition /A/ is an 
internal statement of a 
theory whereas the 
judgement /⊢ A/ is a 
meta-statement. For
example in first order
logic where the only
judgement is the possession
of a proof, /⊢ A/ means
"A has a proof".

Why the emphasis on
the fact that there 
are true theorems 
that can not be proved in
an undecidable theory?
**** Answer:
Because false Theorems can
never be proved in a 
consistent theory. Thus,
the defining feature of
undecidability is the 
existence of non-false
theorems that can't be
proved.

Why is /A ⊢ B/ not the same
as /⊢ A → B/?
**** Answer:
Because it means /B/ can be 
deduced from /A/ independently
of the logic used. The implication
arrow is tied to the logic used
and may not even be available in
a given logic. For example, in
linear logic /A ⊢ B/ means 
/⊢ A ⊸ B/, there is no /→/.

Because if /a/ is
populated there is
no function /a→Void/.
(Except functions that
never return, /undefined/)
If /a/ is not populated
(not necessarily, could
be undefined or b→Void,
if /a/ is false then it
is Void)
then /a/ is /Void/ but
/Void→Void/ is populated
by the identity function
so /a→Void/ is populated.

Why is the recursion
principle for a type
/W/ also called the

**** Answer:
Because it is about constructing
functions out of type /W/, which
are called eliminators. The
/non-dependent/ qualifier serves to
distinguish it from induction
principles, which are about 
constructing dependent functions
out of a type and therefore more
general eliminators.

How is the induction
principle of a type

**** Answer:
The induction principle
is about the construction
of dependent functions /f/ 
from constructors where
/f:∏(w:W),P(w)/ for a
/P:W→𝒰/. The recursion
principle is the special case
where /P/ is constant.

What is the recursion
principle for a type
/W/ all about?
**** Answer:
It means that in order
to define any function
/f:W→P/ it is enough to
consider the case where
/w:W/ arises from one of
the constructors. This
makes it possible to
call /f/ recursively on
the inputs to that 
constructor.

How does Homotopy Type Theory
avoid the difficulties in
representing common mathematical
objects inherent in an intensional
type theory?
**** Answer:
By allowing higher order
constructors constructing
elements of equality datatypes
and equality datatypes of
equality datatypes ad
infinitum.

Why is an intensional type
theory desirable as underpinning
for a programming language?
**** Answer:
Because type checking is decidable
in an intensional theory as
definitional and propositional
equality are distinguished.

What is the determining
feature of /extensional/

**** Answer:
The fact that there is no
distinction between definitional
and propositional equality, 
presumably due to the fact that
entities are defined extensionally,
ie. by listing all inhabitants of
a type.

Why is a dependent function
type for /A:𝒰/ and /B:A→𝒰/

the sequences consist of
function values indexed by
the corresponding arguments.

In which sense differs
type theory from first
order logic as deductive 
system?
**** Answer:
In contrast to first
order logic, type theory
has two judgements
 - /a:A/ "a is an object of type A"
 - /a≡b:A/ "a and b are definitionally
          equal objects of type A"
as compared to the one of
first order logic
/⊢ A/ "A has a proof".

identified with particular 
types.

How does a linear
constraint /Ax=b/ affect
a gradient descent?
**** Answer:
For consecutive points
/xₖ/, xₖ₊₁ satisfying /Ax=b/,
the difference /Δx/ must
lie in the kernel of /A/. Thus
the steepest feasible descent
is along the projection of
the negative gradient into
the kernel of /A/ and not along
that gradient.

How are leaving and

related?
**** Answer:
For entering variable
/xᵢ/, the new direction
is determined as
/p=eᵢ-(B⁻¹Aeᵢ|0)ᵀ/ where
/A=(B|N)/ with /N/ representing
the zero variables of the 
current vertex /x/. The new
vertex is calculated as
/x+μ⁻¹p/ where /μ=max{pᵢ/xᵢ|xᵢ>0}/.
This calculation determines
the leaving variable.

the choice rules for entering
variables has to be invoked, 
such as the /Devex Algorithm/.

What distinguishes independent
random variables /V₁/, /V₂/ in terms 
of their distribution?
**** Answer:
The joint probability distribution
of independent random variables is
the (pure) tensor product 
/μ=μ₁⊗μ₂/ of its marginal distributions
/μ₁/, /μ₂/.

What is the point of
/quasi-probability distributions/?
**** Answer:
That they yield /expectations/ like
normal probability distributions
even though some of the other Axioms
of Kolmogorov may not be satisfied.
This makes them useful in quantum theory
where expectations are required but
amplitudes can be negative.

How are non-locality
and boundary conditions
related?
**** Answer:
Boundaries may induce 
non-locality, for example
if a gas is constrained by
a boundary causing reflection
of particles back into
the gas. This creates a
dependency on previous events
and causes a nonlocality in
time.

How do linear classifiers
/gᵢ(*x*)= *wᵢᵗx* + wᵢ₀/ arise?
**** Answer:
From classification problems
where the class conditional
densities have normal 
distributions with the same 
covariance matrices /Σᵢ=Σ/. 
Using /gᵢ(*x*)=log p(*x* |ωᵢ) + log P(ωᵢ)/
and the fact that *xᵗ* Σᵢ *x* is 
independent of the class /i/, /gᵢ(*x*)/
becomes linear with weights
*wᵢ* = Σ⁻¹ *μᵢ* and bias
/wᵢ₀=-½ *μᵢᵗ* Σ⁻¹ *μᵢ* + P(ωᵢ)/.

Why should classifiers /gᵢ(*x*)/
be at most quadratic under 
reasonable circumstances?
**** Answer:
Because class conditional densities
will be close to normal in many
cases and the quadratic term is needed
to account for differences in covariance.
Thus, /gᵢ(*x*)= *xᵗ* Wᵢ *x* + *wᵢᵗx* + wᵢ₀/ with
/Wᵢ=-½Σᵢ⁻¹, *wᵢ* = Σᵢ⁻¹ *μᵢ*,/ and
/wᵢ₀=-½ *μᵢᵗ* Σᵢ⁻¹ *μᵢ* - ½log |Σᵢ| + log P(ωᵢ)/
should be sufficient for most classifications.

How are classifiers generally
constructed?
**** Answer:
A feature vector *x* should
be classified as belonging
to class /ωᵢ/ for which 
/P(ωᵢ| *x*)/ is maximal. Thus,
classifiers /gᵢ(*x*)/ should be
monotonuous in /P(ωᵢ| *x*)/ and
are often chosen as
/gᵢ(*x*)=p(*x* |ωᵢ)P(ωᵢ)/ or
/gᵢ(*x*)=log p(*x* |ωᵢ) + log P(ωᵢ)/.

Because the classification depends

normal with covariance matrices
/Σᵢ=σ²/ and equal a priori probabilities

vector *p* which determines the
exact density. The probability
to obtain the sample data 
/Χ={*x₁*,…, *xₙ*}/ for the current
class /ω/ is then
/p(Χ| *p*, ω)=∏p(*xₖ* | *p*, ω)/ 
with class conditional density
/p(*xₖ* | *p*,ω)/ for class /ω/ and
maximizing this for *p* is called
the /maximum likelihood/ estimate
for *p*.

How to estimate the
density of a random
variable from a sample
with Parzen windows?
**** Answer:
Use the characteristic function
/φ(x)/ of the unit hypercube
centered at the origin, the
Parzen window, and 
calculate a weighed sum
/1/n∑ᵢ1/Vₙφᵢ/, of /φᵢ=φ((𝐱-𝐱ᵢ)/h)/,
where /n/ is the number of samples, 
/Vₙ/ the volume of a sampling hypercube
and /h/ its edge-length.

for the principle of
/Occam's Razor/?
**** Answer:
The need to avoid overfitting
models to data. If data are
explained with a minimum of
assumptions then there is a
better chance to explain or
predict new data correctly.

Why is the cross-correlation

This comes from the euclidean distance
/E²(m,n)=∑ᵢⱼ(g(i,j)-t(i-m,j-n))²/ which,
after muliplying out the square, has
the middle term
/-2R(m,n)=-2∑ᵢⱼg(i,j)t(i-m,j-n)/,

Is it possible to interpret
matrix elements /aᵢⱼ/ as 
costs to travel from node

**** Answer:
Not with the usual matrix
multiplication. The problem
is that the cost of two step
travel from node /i/ to /j/ is
/minₖ{aᵢₖ+aₖⱼ}/ rather than
regular matrix multiplication.
This works only if multiplication
is defined as /a⊗b=a+b/ and 
summation as /a⊕b=min{a,b}/.

If permutation matrices
permute the indices of
vectors, how do more general
0-1 matrices act on indices?
**** Answer:
There would be a superposition
of indices which could collapse
to a certain index. On the 
other hand, the superposition
could relate to the pre-images
of an index. So if /xₙ↦xᵢ+xⱼ/ this
would mean that /i/ and /j/ are 
preimages of /n/.
Also compare to the interpretation
of 0-1 matrices as paths connecting
nodes.

What does a major mode
make sound major as opposed
to minor?
**** Answer:
The major 3rd distance
between the 1st and 3rd
notes of the scale. The
minors only have a minor
3rd in this place.

in orbit or spin of charged
particles. In those cases, the
magnetic moment doesn't align
with the field but rather rotates
around its direction.

**** Answer:
The gradient of /H/ is
/∇H=(∂ₚH(p,r),∂ᵣH(p,r))/
which is the direction
of steepest descent. Contour
lines are perpendicular to
that, so /(-∂ᵣH(p,r),∂ₚH(p,r)/)
must coincide with the tangent
vectors (ṗ,q̇).

By calculating the action /S/
from the Lagrangian density
/½ρ∂ₜψ(x,t)²-½T∂ₓψ(x,t)²/ representing
the difference between the derivatives
of the kinetic and potential energies.
Here /ψ/ is the displacement from
equilibrium, /ρ/ the mass density
and /T/ the tension. The equation
/δS/δψ/ = 0 will then result in a
partial differential equation for
/ψ,/ its wave equation.

A passive rotation is a
rotation of the observer
whereas an active rotation
is a rotation of the 
observed.

Why should the space-like
components of a four vector
not commute with their
time-like component?
**** Answer:
Because the time-like component
implies change, things like
momentum and velocity depend
on it. Thus, a time-like
operator should change position
eigenstates.

How does /E²-p²/ give
rise to creation and 
annihilation operators?
**** Answer:
An operator equation
like that looks like
a Hamiltonian for a
quantum Harmonic oscillator.
If /[E,p]=1/, then creation and
annihilation can be obtained
by factoring as /a⁺=E-p/,
/a=E+p/.

On the contours, the value
of the Hamiltonian stays
constant. So if the Hamiltonian 
operator were operating
on paths to measure a value,
the contours would be eigenstates.

What could be the 
interpretation of
/E²-c²p²/ for operators
/E, p/ in quantum
mechanics?
**** Answer:
Since /E²-c²p²/ is 
relativistically 
invariant, it should be
related to particle number
or density. It is akin to
a Hamiltonian, the dirac
equation being a factor, thus
its eigenvalues are energy
eigenvalues. Since relativistic
observers differ about energy
but not particle number, the
latter makes the most sense.

Is it possible to view
location as an entanglement
with space?
**** Answer:
Measuring existence at a
certain location implies
measuring non-existence at
all other locations. In that
sense there is a spooky 
action at a distance reminiscent
of measurements on entangled
systems. (There is also the
question of time involved here,
this is for measurements at the
same time, which is different
according to viewpoint.)

In which sense could the

/H/ be useful as a basis for a

**** Answer:
Like the set of coherent
states, it could be an overcomplete
basis for the Hilbert space and
still yield useful values for
operator expectations, as long
as their density matrix is
diagonalisable.
(Note this is more like a Krylov
space, so the /Hⁿv/ should probably
be orthogonalized, as in Lanzcos)

How to explain superluminal
effects within quantum systems?
**** Answer:
By not being able to measure
them externally. External
interactions lead to decoherence
and a spatial collapse, thus
preventing external energy
transport.
(Perhaps any interaction that
could lead to superluminal
effects causes decoherence!)

Why should quantum states
be described by vector
spaces rather than mere
vectors?
**** Answer:
To accommodate things like
special relativity where
different observers have a
different view of a state. 
Thus, different state vectors
could describe the same state,
in this case all vectors in
an irreducible representation
of the Lorentz group, which is
a vector space.

Why are events with

**** Answer:
Because this means that the

distance light travels, thus
different space-like events must
occur at different places for
all observers, ie they are 
separated by space.

How to get the period of

From the Fourier transform
1/n∑ₖₓexp(2πikx/n)|k⟩|f(x)⟩.
Due to the periodicity of /f/,
only states /|k⟩|φ⟩/ with
k=0 or k a multiple of
n/p, p the period of f, will
have non-zero amplitudes.
Measuring /|k⟩/ will provide
one of these numbers.

How to achieve superposition
of qbits in a system where
they are modeled by proton
spin?
**** Answer:
The qbits are changed by
applying magnetic pulses to
it. The length of the pulse
determines the reaction of
the qbits with shorter pulses
generally resulting in 
superpositions whereas longer
pulses may just flip the states.

Because the energy levels between
electron spin states are not big
enough. While possible, this works

How is a qbit realised by an
Ion Trap measured?
**** Answer:
By applying a laser interacting
only with one of the states, say |1⟩.
If the qbit collapses into this
state, it will be excited and emit
photons during decay, which can
then be measured. Otherwise, no
signal is received.

Every relativistic observer
has a different view of the
evolution of a particle, so
each observer has its own 
Hamiltonian. If these 
Hamiltonians have some 
algebraic structure, their
irreducible representations
would qualify as particle 
representations. Especially
if they turn out to be the
same as those of the Lorentz
group.

What is the principle
of quantum teleportation?
**** Answer:
Sender and receiver share
an entangled quantum system.
The sender combines the quantum
state to be sent with the
entangled system and measures
it, thus destroying the original
entanglement. The result is sent 
by classical means to the 
receiver and determines the
filter that needs to be applied 
to the receiver's part of the 
system to recover the quantum
state of the sender.

determining handedness for
a particular size. The size
would correspond to the
direction of spin measurement
and handed-ness to spin in
the chosen direction.

How are entanglement and
causation related?
**** Answer:
Just as correlation does
not imply causation, it also
does not imply entanglement.

Why does spooky action at
a distance make more sense
than hidden variables?
**** Answer:
Because in many cases an
infinite number of hidden
variables would be needed, 
for example in spin measurements
a variable is needed for every
direction.

What is the difference between
hidden variable theories and
non-locality?
**** Answer:
In hidden variable theories,
correlations are set up at
the time of entanglement. In
non-locality, correlations are
set up at the time of measurement.
(Like lazy evaluation, a property
is determined when it is needed.)

Why is superluminal
communication through
a shared entangled
system not possible?
**** Answer:
Because the correlated properties
of the system can not be
manipulated, only measured.
Thus, sharing an entangled
electron pair doesn't allow
to communicate via spin because
the sender would have to set
a certain spin state. But the
state can only be measured, not
set.

How does the type of
a classical field
affect its quantum
representation?
**** Answer:
The quantum representation
is an operator field no
matter the field type. However,
for scalar fields the eigenvalues
of the operators are scalars, for
vector fields they will be vectors
and generally for fields of any
tensor type the eigenvalues of
the operators will be tensors of
that type.

How to determine the type of
the eigenvalues for an operator 
of a quantum field?
**** Answer:
Normally by looking at the matrix
elements of the operator. If they
are scalars then the operator will
have scalar eigenvalues. In general,
if the matrix elements have a certain
tensor type then the eigenvalues will
be of that tensor type as well.

In which sense are fermion
fields less uncertain than
boson fields?
**** Answer:
There is less uncertainty
in the particle number
because in fermion fields
states /|n⟩/, /n∈{0,1}/ rather
than /n∈ℕ/. Thus, coherent
states are superpositions
of only /|0⟩, |1⟩/ rather
than superpositions of an
infinite number of particle

Why are coherent states
still useful, despite
their non-orthogonality?
**** Answer:
Because their density 
operator /ρ̂/ can be diagonalised,
ie. /ρ̂=∫f(α,α*)|α⟩⟨α|d²α/ with
a quasiprobability /f(α,α*)/.

What makes the use of coherent
spaces so attractive in quantum
optics?
**** Answer:
The /optical equivalence theorem/, which
states that the expectation of an operator
/g(Ω,â,â⁺)/ expressible as power series in
/â, â⁺/ with respect to order /Ω/ is
/⟨g(Ω,â,â⁺)⟩=∫f(Ω,α,α*)g(Ω,α,α*)dα dα*/
with a quasiprobability /f/ that depends
on the ordering /Ω/ of the operators.

**** Answer:
Since they relate to the irreducible representations

/m/ and /s/ commonly related to mass and spin. 
However, representations related to imaginary 
masses and continuous spin are discarded as
unphysical.

wave equations ?
**** Answer:
Because the irreducible representations of the

corresponding to /m>0/ can have only spins of 
integer and half-integer values. Thus, for 
positive mass the representations can be 
described in terms of wave-equations.

Why is the description of a quantum field
theory in terms of creation and annihilation
operators on a Hilbert space the natural 
thing to do?
**** Answer:
Because of its relationship with measurements
which consist of counting particles, be it
with Geiger counters or in particle accelerators.
The composition /vₖ=uₖ⁺uₖ/ of a creation
with an annihilation operator results in a counting
operator which counts the number of particles of
a given type in a given state.

many particles in a field theory?
**** Answer:
The Hilbert space required becomes too big, as a
result there will be unitarily inequivalent 
representations of the creation and annihilation
operators on the space. As a consequence, 
counting particles with the density operator
will give different results in different
representations. (Maybe just what is needed

Where does the idea that
quantum states interact
via particles come from?
**** Answer:
This is from the modelling
of interaction amplitudes 
as Taylor series in /⟨a|Hⁿ|b⟩/.
Writing the second order
coefficient in terms of matrix
elements,
/⟨a|H²|b⟩=∑⟨a|H|γ⟩⟨γ|H|b⟩/
with intermediary states
/γ/, these states play the
role of interaction particles,
ie /b/ turns into /a/ with amplitude
/⟨a|H²|b⟩/ via the intermediary
/γ/.

What actually happens when
two photons interfere?
**** Answer:
Actually, photons only
can self-interfere. Two
photon interference is 
actually self-interference
of a two photon state.
See the /Grangier Experiment/.

How are Hermitian operators
related to measurements?
**** Answer:
Every Hermition operator
describes a measurement by
decomposing the state space
into its eigenspaces.

How is a Hermitian operator
applied to a measurement?
**** Answer:
A hermitian operator /H/ can
be written as /H=∑ᵢλᵢPᵢ/ 
where /Pᵢ/ is the projection
onto the eigenspace of
/λᵢ/. When measuring a state
expressed as linear combination
/|v⟩=∑ᵢσᵢ|i⟩/ of eigenspaces of
/H/, projection /Pᵢ/ is selected
with probability /|σᵢ|²/ and
applied to /|v⟩/.

Why is the no-cloning
theorem a necessity
from a measurement point

**** Answer:
Because the ability to
clone an unknown quantum
state would imply the
possibility to measure
complementary observables by
measuring them separately
on the clones.

What is a common
misconception when
looking at state
changes /⟨φ|ψ⟩/?
**** Answer:
That the states /φ/,
/ψ/ are states of the
measured system. In reality,
they are states of the 
instruments involved in the
measurement: /ψ/ is the state
of the preparator after
preparation of the system
and /φ/ is the state of the
measurer after the 
measurement. The states of
the system can be infinitely
richer, a fact that may not
be reflected in the measurement
device.

What quantum states would 
most resemble classical states?
**** Answer:
States that minimize the 
uncertainty relations, ie
the operator variances
/⟨ψ|A²|ψ⟩-⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩²/ in state
/φ/ should be mimised as far
as possible without spreading
out any conjugate operators
unduly.

How is the classical limit
of quantum physics related
to the expectations of its
operators?
**** Answer:
For states /φ/ that are close
to classical states the equations
between the expectations
/⟨φ|A|φ⟩/ of the quantum operators
should be close to those
between the corresponding 
classical observables.

Why is /⟨∂ₜA⟩=∂ₜ⟨A⟩/?
**** Answer:
Because /⟨A⟩=⟨φ|A|φ⟩/ and states
/φ/ are constant in time in the 
Heisenberg picture. As a consequence,
the time derivative distributes over
the inner product.

Do the expectations of operators
have to satisfy the equations of
their classical counterparts?
**** Answer:
No, they only have to be close
enough so that the equations hold
for states that are close to
classical, ie high energy or
concentrated wave functions.

How does the correspondence
principle manifest itself
in Ehrenfest's theorem?
**** Answer:
According to Ehrenfest, the
expected values of position and
momentum satisfy /m∂ₜ⟨x⟩=⟨p⟩/ and
/∂ₜ⟨p⟩=-⟨V'(x)⟩/, which are almost
the classical relations between
position and momentum. For the 
classical relations to be satisfied,
the second equation should read
/∂ₜ⟨p⟩=-V'(⟨x⟩)/. However, in the
classical limit of highly concentrated
wave-functions, both /V'(⟨x⟩)/ and
/⟨V(x)⟩/ will be very close to /V(x₀)/,
where /x₀/ is the concentration point
of the wave-function.

What is the value of spin
of a particle?
**** Answer:
The rotation of a particle
is described by
*U(φ)* = exp(-i/ℏ i *φ·(L+S)*)
with spin matrix vector *S*.
Its squared length can be 
written as *S²* = S(S+1)ℏ²I
with I the identity matrix.
The value /S/ is the spin of
the particle.

Since *S* is a vector of spin
matrices, *U(φ)* is a matrix
of operators.

How does spin arise in
a vector particle?
**** Answer:
A vector particle is
described by a vector
field *ψ(x)* and a rotation
*U(φ)* affects both the 
argument *x* and the vector
*ψ*. When analysing the
situation, it turns out
that *U(φ)* = exp(-i/ℏ *φ·(L+S)*),
where *L* is the angular momentum
operator that also affects
scalar fields and *S* is a new
component needed to describe
the vector rotation. This
component is called the /spin/
of the particle.

Do energy and momentum
always commute?
**** Answer:
At least for non-relativistic
free particles. Here, spatially
translated wave-functions
/U(σ)φ(r,t)/ are supposed to
behave the same as the original
/φ(r,t)/, ie they satisfy the same
free Schrödinger equation
/iℏ∂ₜφ=Hφ/ with Hamiltonian /H/. 
As a consequence, /H/ and
the translation operator /U(σ)/
commute. But /U(σ)=exp(-iσP/ℏ)/ with
momentum operator /P/, so /H/ and
/P/ commute as well.

the three-dimensional Taylor
expansion of /φ(r-σ,t)/ around

/U(σ)=exp(-iσP/ℏ)/

How does a beam splitter
give rise to an operator?
**** Answer:
A beam splitter is a device
with two inputs and two 
outputs. It transforms incoming
electric fields /E₁/, /E₂/ into
output fields /E₃/, /E₄/ via
/E₁ → τE₃+ρE₄/ and 
/E₂ → ρE₃+τE₄/
with reflection and transmission
amplitudes /ρ, τ/. If the splitter
is lossless, this is a unitary
transformation.

How to check that the particle
created by
/Φ(x)=∑ₚaₚ⁺exp(-ipx)=φ⁺(x)/ is at

**** Answer:
By looking at the matrix element
/⟨y|φ⁺(x)|0⟩=∑ₚ⟨y|aₚ⁺|0⟩exp(-ipx)/,
which is /∑ₚ⟨y|p⟩exp(-ipx)/, and, since
/⟨y|p⟩=Cexp(-ipy)/ for a constant /C/,
/⟨y|φ⁺(x)|0⟩=∑ₚexp(-ip(x-y))/. Thus,

How to check that
/Φ(x)=∑ₚaₚ⁺exp(-ipx)=φ⁺(x)/ creates
one particle?
**** Answer:
By applying the number operator
/N=∑ₚnₚ/ counting the total number
of particles regardless of momentum
to state /φ⁺(x)|0⟩=|Ψ⟩/. Since
/N|Ψ⟩=|Ψ⟩/, /|Ψ⟩/ is an eigenstate of
/N/ to eigenvalue 1, thus it represents
a single particle state.

What does it mean for
an excitation of a quantum
field to be countable?
**** Answer:
That every measurement 
interaction affects a 
unit as a whole. For example
a single particle is changed as
a whole by every measurement,
no matter how spread out it
appears in space and time.

How can a two component wave
function /ψ=(α,β)ᵀ/ be interpreted
in terms of probabilities?
**** Answer:
This is interpreted as the wave
function of a spin-½ particle whose
component /α/ is the probability amplitude
for the particle in the spin-up state
whereas component /β/ is the probability
amplitude for the particle in the 
spin-down state. So the wave functions
correspond to conditional probabilities.

What is the meaning of the four 
components in the Dirac spinors?
**** Answer:
The spinors /ψ=(u,v)ᵀ/ really describe
particle-antiparticle pairs. Since these
are spin-½ particles, each of them has
two components representing spin-up 
and spin-down states thus leading to
four components overall.

How come the usual interpretation
of /|ψ|²/ as probability density
fails for the solutions /ψ/
of the Klein-Gordon equation?
**** Answer:
Because the probability density
interpretation is derived from
/conservation of probability/
/∂ₜρ+∇J=0/ with density /ρ/ and 
probability flux /J/. Here,
this turns out to be
/ρ=i(ψ̄∂ₜψ-ψ∂ₜψ̄)/.The form /ρ=|ψ|²/ 
is particular to the 
Schrödinger equation.

Via the probability current

proper wave equation, the solution
can be as simple as /ρ=|ψ|²/ as in the

How does the identity of particle
types come about?
**** Answer:
Through observables whose eigenstates
are energy eigenstates but with few
eigenvalues, such as electric charge,
parity etc. This way, these properties
won't change in time, thus conveying
individuality through durability. The
low number of eigenvalues avoids 
the confusion of multitudes.

Why does beta decay
/n → p+e+v̄ₑ/ involve an
anti-neutrino instead
of a neutrino?
**** Answer:
Because lepton number has
to be preserved. Neutron
/n/ and proton /p/ both have 
lepton number 0 as
non-leptons whereas the 
electron has lepton number 1.
Thus, the neutrino part needs
to have lepton number -1 requiring
it to be an anti-neutrino.

What is the idea of using the path-integral
to describe 
/I=⟨q_F|e⁻ⁱᴴᵀ|q_I⟩/?
**** Answer:
To split the /T/ into shorter intervals
/dt/ and then write 
/e⁻ⁱᴴᵀ=∏ e⁻ⁱᴴᵈᵗ/. This
then allows to split up /I/ into a sum
of products of intermediate state changes
/⟨qⱼ₊₁|e⁻ⁱᴴᵈᵗ|qⱼ⟩/
using the fact that the /qⱼ/ form an 
orthonormal system. The hope is that the
intermediate state changes are easier to
obtain and make sense in the limit as
/dt → 0/.

Because, for many frequently occuring 
Hamiltonians /H/ it can be expressed in
terms of the corresponding Lagrangian /L/,
more precisely as time-integral of /L/, 
also called the action. In addition, for
/ℏ → 0/ the classical path
is obtained.

Why is /lack of reality/
not a strong argument
against Wigner's subjective
theory of wave-function
collapse?
**** Answer:
Because even if different
observers have their own
reality (=phenomenology),
these realities need not
be arbitrary. It takes
only one perception they
agree on to translate between
the phenomenologies, as
happens with observers in
relativity who all perceive
the same speed of light.

Taylor expansion. Using the correpondence
principle it can be shown that in the classical
limit the expectation of /H/ is the energy.
However, due to the uncertainty principle, the
form of the hamiltonian /H/ is not completetely
determined by the correspondence principle.

Is there a way to derive the
Schrödinger equation without
recourse to the form of definite
energy-state wave-functions?
**** Answer:
Yes, the linearity of quantum
mechanics leads to the requirement
of /ψ(t')=U(t',t)ψ(t)/ with /U(t',t)/
a unitary operator for the change
of state from /t/ to /t'/. Taylor expansion
to first order leads to 
/U(t',t)~1-iH(t'-t)/ with /H/ hermitian and
in the limit /t'→ t/ to the Schrödinger
equation with /H/. Checking expectation
values for /H/ and using the correspondence
principle shows that the expectation
of /H/ is the classical energy.

Why are the symmetries
of a quantum system of
interest for its
description?
**** Answer:
The symmetry group of
a quantum system is the
group of all unitary operators
commuting with its Hamiltonian.
Thus, the Hamiltonian is a 
Casimir Operator of the symmetry
group. For a quantum system with
unknown Hamiltonian, the symmetries
can be used to construct a 
Hamiltonian, or at least to derive
some minimal requirements for it.

Why is it impossible to
clone arbitrary states?
**** Answer:
This is precluded by
linearity. A linear
operator /U/ cloning
via /U|a⟩|0⟩=|a⟩|a⟩/
on ie. a basis of /V/
can not clone superpositions
/|c⟩/ of basis vectors /|a⟩/ and
/|b⟩/ because the clone
would contain mixed terms
/|a⟩|b⟩/ and /|b⟩|a⟩/ whereas
/U|c⟩|0⟩=|c⟩|c⟩/ would not.

What is coherence?
**** Answer:
A property of two signals
reminiscent of correlation. It
compares average cross-correlation
/Sᵤᵥ/ of signals /u(t), v(t)/ to their
average autocorrelations /Sᵤᵤ, Sᵥᵥ/
and is defined as
/γᵤᵥ(f) = |Sᵤᵥ(f)|²/(Sᵤᵤ(f)Sᵥᵥ(f))/
where /Sᵤᵤ(f)/ is the Fourier 
transform of the autocorrelation
of signal /u(t)/ and similarly
for /Sᵥᵥ(f)/ and /v(t)/. /Sᵤᵥ(f)/ 
is the Fourier transform of the 
crosscorrelation of signals 
/u(t), v(t)/.

Why does the

It requires hardware support
expressed by the presence of

Check if there is a brightness

~sudo find /sys -type f -iname '*brightness*'.~
If so, link an entry in =/sys/class/backlight=
to it, if not then there is no hardware
support for brightness changes.

Why is it not a good
idea to copy system directories

Because copying doesn't keep file
ownership intact. This may break
applications requiring write access
to certain areas of ie /var.

That was removed in the transition

its dbus-service configuration, the

had to be removed by hand to make
room for the new one, which has
~Exec=/bin/false~ to reflect the fact
that the original systemd-shim

Why does =apt-get upgrade=
often not upgrade the kernel?
**** Answer:
Kernel upgrades usually come
as a new package which is a new
dependency of the kernel
meta-package. As such, it will not
be installed by =apt-get upgrade=
until the meta-package is upgraded,
it needs =apt-get dist-upgrade=
to be run.

How to use ~xrandr~ to detect
whether the system is connected
to HDMI?
**** Answer
Pipe ~xrandr~ through ~grep ' connected'~
and ~grep 'HDMI'~ and then through
~awk '{print $1}'~ to print the first
column. This will result in an
empty string if there is no connection
and in a device string otherwise. This
can be tested with ~! -z "$RESULT"~ which
returns true if the string in ~$RESULT~
is non-empty.

How to fool a package
such as android-tools-adb
to think it stopped its
init.d service?
**** Answer:
Put a symbolic link from
~/lib/systemd/system/android-tools-adbd.service~
to ~/dev/null~. The pre-removal
script for android-tools-adb calls 
~invoke-rc.d android-tools-adbd stop~
which will now succeed with this link.
Note this has been an issue with systems
changing their init procedures, such as 
ubuntu between 16 and 18, where it was
hard to update this package because the 
old version couldn't be removed.

How to configure xmonad
to exhibit the network
connection icon?
**** Answer:
Install ~xmobar~ or something
equivalent and ~stalonetray~.
Then ~spawn "stalonetray"~ in
the ~startupHook~ in xmonad.hs.
If ~nm-applet~ is already running
(i.e. due to an lxsession or 
some such), this will bring up
the network icon. Otherwise
spawn nm-applet as well, 
presumably before stalonetray.

What is the difference
between using an /autostart/
file and an /autostart/
directory to start applications
at login?
**** Answer:
The /autostart/ file in
=~/.config‌/<sessionname>/$DESKTOP_SESSION=
is session specific whereas the
/autostart/ directory
=~/.config/autostart=
works for all sessions that
comply with freedesktop.org
standards.
