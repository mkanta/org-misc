Various emacs org files to make life easier.

- drillcards.org :: Drillcards on a variety of subjects dear to my heart. Some
  of them still use latex, although I'm trying to convert it to UTF-8. Although
  latex looks better, a latex installation is required to generate the 
  images, a losing proposition when trying to use it on a phone. Possible with
  ie. Termux on Android but hard on memory.
- resumeTemplate.org :: A resume skeleton in org. To use this, open the file
  in Emacs and:
  1. Put your name on the top
  2. Edit the lines starting with #+MACRO to put your personal info
  3. Edit the body with your work experiences, skills etc.
  4. Export it by hitting ~C-c C-e~ and choosing your format, as it is, only
     pdf works reasonably well, everything else may not format properly.
  Note that resumeTemplate.sty is needed for pdf-export, as well as a working
  latex installation. Test for the latter's presence with ~which pdflatex~ in 
  a terminal.
