Various emacs org files to make life easier.

- drillcards.org :: Drillcards on a variety of subjects dear to my heart. Some
  of them still use latex, although I'm trying to convert it to UTF-8. Although
  latex looks better, a latex installation is required to generate the 
  images, a losing proposition when trying to use it on a phone. Possible with
  ie. Termux on Android but hard on memory.
- resumeTemplate.org :: A resume skeleton in org.
