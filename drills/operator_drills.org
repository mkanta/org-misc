Why do time evolutions
/A(t)/ of an operator
/A/ in general not commute?
** Answer:
Because the projection
operators /Pᵢ/ onto the
eigenspaces evolve
as /Pᵢ(t)=U⁺(t)PᵢU(t)/,
hence eigenvectors evolve
as /U(t)v/, which result
in different eigenspaces
unless /U(t)/ merely
permutes them.

Why are continuous paths
not observable in quantum
mechanics?
** Answer:
Because observables 
/A(t)=U⁺(t)AU(t)/
can commute only for a
countable subset /{tₙ}/
corresponding to rational
angles for /U(t)/, where
eigenspaces may be permuted.
(What about continuous
spectra?)
