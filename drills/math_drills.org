What distinguishes natural
from unnatural transformations
between functors /F, G/?
**** Answer:
In a natural transformation,
the commutativity in
/η(Y)∘F(f)=G(f)∘η(X)/ only
depends on objects 
/X, Y/ of the source
category but not on
the morphism /f/. In an
unnatural transformation
there are morphisms where
this commutativity with
/η(X), η(Y)/ is violated.

between functors 
/F, G:C→D/?
**** Answer:
A collection of arrows
/η(X):F(X)→G(X)/ in category
/D/ indexed by objects /X/
from category /C/.

What are the consequences
of a category having
finite limits and colimits?
**** Answer:
The presence of initial and
terminal objects as well as
equalizers and coequalizer.

Why is the presence of
an initial object
in a category with
finite limits and colimits not
surprising?
**** Answer:
Because a finite colimit of
no object would correspond 
to a disjoint union of no
sets, hence the empty set
which is a special case of
an initial object.

Why is the presence of
terminal objects in a 
category with finite limits
and colimits not surprising?
**** Answer:
Terminal objects are like
one element sets, since 
there is an initial set
a terminal object should
be constructible by packing
the initial object.

What is an equalizer
in a category?
**** Answer:
The equivalent of the subset
consisting of all /x ∈ X/ such that
/f(x)=g(x)/ for morpisms /X→Y/.
